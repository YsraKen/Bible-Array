  <Description>k__BackingField: "King James Version (KJV)\r\n\r\nThe King James Version
    (KJV) of the holy Bible was first printed in 1611, but the main edition used
    today is the 1769 version. The King James Version (KJV) is also known as the
    Authorized (or Authorised) Version (AV) because it was authorized to be read
    in churches. For over 300 years it was the main English translation used in the
    English speaking world, and is much admired and respected. About 400 words and
    phrases coined or popularised by the King James Version are part the English
    language today. \r\n\r\nRevision\r\n\r\nThe King James Version of the Bible was
    not a new translation but a revision of the English Bible which was commissioned
    by King James I of Great Britain, following the Church of England Hampton Court
    Conference in 1604. 54 scholars from London, Oxford and Cambridge worked on the
    project. They were all from the Church of England (Anglicans), but included those
    of traditional and Puritan views.\r\n\r\nOfficially the 1586 Bishop\u2019s Bible
    was used as the base for the revision, but the scholars referenced all existing
    Bible translations in English, such as the Geneva Bible and Tyndale, and also
    editions in other languages. The completed Bible was first printed in 1611, and
    included the Apocrypha, which is omitted from this edition. \r\n\r\n1769 edition\r\n\r\nIn
    1611 English spelling and punctuation were not in standard forms, and the Bible
    underwent a mainly-orthographic revision by Oxford and Cambridge universities
    in 1769, which is the version most people use today. The rights of the King James
    Version of the Bible were, and still are, protected under British law and are
    vested in the Crown. \r\n\r\nBible Society edition\r\n\r\nIn 1804 the British
    and Foreign Bible Society (BFBS) was founded and they printed millions of cheap
    copies of the Bible for people to buy and read. Through the work of the Bible
    Societies the King James Version (KJV) became the most printed and most widely
    read book in the world. \r\n\r\n1954 Paragraphed Edition\r\n\r\nThe King James
    Version was printed with each new verse starting on a new line. In 1954 the British
    and Foreign Bible Society produced a new edition of the KJV, keeping the original
    1769 text, but adding sub-titles and paragraphs, making it easier to read. In
    2011 this was reprinted in a special edition, with other appendices such as a
    Glossary, and concordance, to mark the 400th anniversary of the King James Version.
    This is the text used in this on-line edition. The paragraphing, sub-headings
    from 1954, and other additions from 2011, are copyright the British and Foreign
    Bible Society.\r\n\r\nCopyright Information\r\n\r\nRights in the Authorized (King

    edition of the King James Authorised Version was paragraphed with sub-headings
    added by the British and Foreign Bible Society in 1954 and released again as
    a special edition in 2011.\r\n\r\nBFBS additions \xA9 2011 British and Foreign
