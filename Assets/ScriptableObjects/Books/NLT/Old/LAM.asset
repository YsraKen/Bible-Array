            in the order of the Hebrew alphabet. The first word of each verse begins
            with a successive Hebrew letter. Chapters 1, 2, and 4 have one verse
            for each of the 22 Hebrew letters. Chapter 3 contains 22 stanzas of three
            verses each. Though chapter 5 has 22 verses, it is not an acrostic.
