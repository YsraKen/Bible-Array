        content: "  Although most translations view v.    as an independent sentence
          serving as a general heading, it is likely that the first phrase serves
          as a subordinate time clause, such as \u201CAt the beginning [of time],
          God created\u201D or \u201CWhen God began the creation of heaven and the
          earth.\u201D The first word in Hebrew is    and means \u201Cfirst,\u201D
          \u201Cchief,\u201D or \u201Cfirstfruits.\u201D Genesis gives us    of God\u2019s
          creation. The New Testament takes us into the new creation life of Christ
          until all things are made new.      This is the word  , the commonly used
          Hebrew term for God. It stresses his sovereignty and power and could be
          translated \u201CMighty God.\u201D    is the plural of    and occurs nearly
          2,600 times in the Bible.    is derived from the word  , which means \u201Cto
          worship\u201D or \u201Cto adore,\u201D and presents God as the one worthy
          of worship and adoration. After the word  , there is an untranslatable
          marking, which most scholars believe is a direct object marker with the
          first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet. However, it is seen by some
          as the word known as  , which occurs over seven thousand times in the Hebrew
          text of the Old Testament. Some believe that this could be pointing to
          Jesus Christ who declared himself to be \u201Cthe Aleph and the Tav,\u201D
          or \u201Cthe Beginning and the End\u201D (,  ;  ;  ). The first verse of
          the Bible shouts out: \u201CGod is all powerful!\u201D      This is the
          word  , which is used in the Old Testament exclusively for God\u2019s creativity,
          things that only God can do. Creating is an integral part of God\u2019s
          nature.      Or \u201Cthe sky and the land.\u201D This is a merism (a figure
          of speech using two contrasting words to refer to an entirety) for the
          entire universe. See  ,  . The Hebrew word for \u201Cheaven\u201D appears

          God spoke and shattered the cosmic silence to give birth to creation. God
          spoke ten times in the creation account\u2014the Ten Commandments of creation.
          See  ;  . God\u2019s thoughts had already imagined and shaped the largest
          galaxy and the smallest atom before he created them. With exquisite skill
          and creativity, God shaped all things by his word and spoke them into being
          with intricate detail and skill (see  ). A dimension separate from the
          being of God was birthed. No detail was too small for God as he prepared
          to unveil his masterpiece of wisdom, his dream come true. God spoke order
          and goodness into his creation.      Or \u201Cand there was light.\u201D
          God created light but did not create the sun until the fourth day. God
          himself filled the universe with the light of his presence and glory. The
          Hebrew verbs used with the phrases \u201CLet there be\u201D and \u201Cand
          there was\u201D are both related to the holy name      (\u201Clet there
          be\u201D) and    (\u201Cand there was\u201D). As he released this word
          of power, the universe began to expand and has been expanding ever since
          (see  ). God\u2019s kingdom operates according to the principle of endless
          increase (see  ), not of power that diminishes over time.    "

          the virtues of Christ. See  ;  . The progress of creation moves from the
          lower to the higher, from the darker to the brighter, from the evening
          to the morning. The Word of God put light into darkness, land in the midst
          of sea, air in the midst of water, and life in the midst of the uninhabited
          earth. In creation, God started with form and filled it with fullness.

          who he is into all his creation. He created trees after their kind, birds
          after their kind, fish after their kind, and animals after their kind,
          but now he creates a God-kind of being. Christ is the image of God; man
          and woman will resemble him and bring his image into the created order
          (see  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). The first man, Adam, was a type or figure of

          female (see  ), but he has both male and female dimensions to his nature.
          What is this image given to each of us? It includes personality, the capacity
          for worship, the ability to make moral decisions (our conscience), and
          the ability to reflect God. Created as his image-bearers, all human beings

          God\u2019s loving gifts can be seen in giving man his life-breath, a beautiful
          place of bliss (Eden) to work in, and now, a life-partner.      This is
          the Hebrew word  , a term frequently used for military help and ascribed
          to God himself fourteen times (e.g.,  ;  ). It could be translated \u201Cstrong
          rescuer.\u201D We would never say that God is inferior to man, nor should
          we say the woman is inferior to man, for both God and the woman are  .
          God\u2019s choice of the word    indicates that a man\u2019s wife is his
          first line of defense and an equal partner in the journey of life. The   
          is God\u2019s gift to the husband. The wife\u2019s role is more than that
          of an assistant to the man. She is the dynamic solution to man\u2019s loneliness
          as one who protects, reveals, and helps. Some see the ancient pictographic
          rendering of    as    (eye) -    (man) -    (weapon), to mean \u201Cthe
          revealer of the enemy.\u201D Both God and Adam wanted a partner. God wanted
          mankind to till and work the garden, accomplishing God\u2019s purpose for
          them\u2014to bring forth fruit. But Adam needed a bride, a partner for
          life who would be able to live and move and have her being in him. So God
          gave Adam a job and a wife. All of this was to be a picture to Adam of
          God\u2019s yearning for a forever partner who will not just work alongside
          of him but also love and cherish him.    "

          the first of many name changes in the Bible. The Hebrew contains a pun,

          the ability to not only have babies but to also release life in a variety
          of expressions. Eve brought life into the structure of Adam\u2019s world.
          What does the Scripture tell us about the woman? First, she is God\u2019s
          chosen    (see  ), a protector, a provider, and a source of strength for
          a man. Second, she was taken from man, equally a partner under the Lord
          and perfectly matched for reunion as one. Third, she is the carrier of
          life for all humanity. A woman enfolds all three roles in one person.    "

          and accept Cain if he did well by bringing an acceptable offering. This
          is not condemnation, but an invitation for Cain to change his ways. The
          Hebrew word for \u201Cuplifting\u201D is taken from the root word  , which
          means \u201Cto carry away,\u201D \u201Cto take away,\u201D \u201Cto lift

          () is frequently associated with a demon. Sin is seen as a demon-beast
          crouching at the door of Cain\u2019s heart. However, the word for \u201Csin\u201D
          can also mean \u201Csin offering.\u201D God could be telling Cain that
          there is a sin offering, as a resting lamb, lying outside his door to be
          the acceptable sacrifice. They were opening a portal to the presence of
          God. If the sacrifice was accepted, the portal (Hb.  ) to God\u2019s presence

          (LXX). This is one of the most difficult verses in Genesis to interpret.
          There is much debate over the identity of these  , yet we see that they
          are linked to the \u201CNephilim (giants),\u201D the corrupting of the
          divine \u201Cseed of the woman\u201D who was to come (), and the judgment
          of God through the flood. Many scholars view \u201Cthe sons of the gods\u201D
          as sons of Seth (the godly lineage), but the line of Seth is nowhere stated
          to be a godly line; in fact, only Noah was considered righteous in God\u2019s
          eyes. Other scholars see them as a reference to a group of fallen angels
          \u201Cin rebellion who went outside their rightful domain of authority
          and abandoned their appointed realms\u201D to have sexual relations with
          women (). Consequently, God \u201Cthrew them into the lowest, darkest dungeon
          of gloom and locked them in chains\u201D (). The argument that they could
          not be fallen angels because angels cannot marry (see  ) is in reference
          to angels who are in heaven, not the angels who came to earth as part of
          Satan\u2019s plan to cohabitate with women and corrupt the human race.
          Virtually all of the earliest writings of Jewish and Christian literature
          interpret the phrase \u201Cthe sons of the gods\u201D as heavenly beings
          known as fallen angels or \u201Cwatchers.\u201D See also  ;  ;  ;  ; Dead
          Sea scrolls 1QapGen, 4QDtj and 4QDtq; the Damascus Document 4Q180; the

          Eusebius, Clement of Alexandria, and Origen. The coming of the Lord (Gr.

          made from sturdy wood (the humanity of Christ, see  ) and is sealed with
          tar (blood atonement). It was a place of salvation and preservation (Jesus
          our Savior). As man was invited into the ark to find a place of security
          from judgment, so we are hidden in Christ (see  ). All who entered the
          ark were kept safe and none perished. The dimensions of the ark are significant.
          It was 300 cubits long (300 is the number of complete victory in Christ
          [see  ;  ;  ]), 50 cubits wide (50 is the number of Jubilee and Pentecost
          [see  ]), and 30 cubits high (30 is the number of maturity, authority,
          and full stature [see  ;  ;  ;  ], and priests began their ministry at
          30). The ark only had one door, and there is only one door of salvation
          (see  ;  ). The door was on the side of the ark, and Jesus\u2019 side was
          pierced (see  ). There were three stories or levels to Noah\u2019s ark,
          which points to a full salvation for man\u2019s body, soul, and spirit
          (see  ; Noah\u2019s family lived on the third level). There were many rooms
          (\u201Ccompartments\u201D) in the ark, and there are many rooms in the
          Father\u2019s house (; see  ). The ark came to rest in the seventh month
          on the seventeenth day. The Passover was the fourteenth day of the seventh
          month, and three days later (the seventeenth day) was the resurrection
          (Christ \u201Cresting\u201D on high). The ark rested on Mt. Ararat, which
          means \u201Cthe curse is reversed\u201D or \u201Chigh and holy land.\u201D
          To be \u201Cin the ark\u201D is to be \u201Cin Christ\u201D (see  ). The
          Bible mentions three arks, and each point to Christ: Noah\u2019s ark, the

          he appeared in a burning bush, or as an angel, or in a dream. God is able
          to speak in whatever way he chooses. We have a God who speaks to those
          whose ways are blameless. Noah moved with faith and acted on the revelation
          given to him. Do you respond when God speaks?      The implication is that
          God was in the ark waiting for Noah to enter and come to him. He has always
          gone before us and knows what we will face. This Hebrew word for \u201Ccome\u201D

          did Abram have a temple to worship in, a Bible to read, or a priest to

          than just his relatives. He was calling Abram out from specific deity worship
          connected to nations, clans, and ancestors.      Leaving all that is familiar

        content: "  There are varying viewpoints on the identity of Melchizedek;
          some scholars view Melchizedek as merely a type or picture of Christ or
          a Canaanite royal priest. Others believe that he was a Christophany, a
          pre-incarnate appearance of Christ as both a priest of the Most High God
          and the King of Salem (peace). He appeared out of nowhere, with no genealogy
          or pedigree other than being a king-priest. Two Dead Sea scrolls dating
          back to at least the first century BC found in Cave 11 at Qumran (11Q13,
          11QMelch), state that Melchizedek was a divine being, and was given the
          Hebrew title  . According to this text, Melchizedek proclaimed the Day
          of Atonement as a day coming when one will atone for the sins of the people
          and will be their supernatural deliverer and their judge (see Wise, Abegg,
          Cook [1996].  ). See also footnote on  ;  ;  ,  ;  ;  . In  , Jesus said

          to meet him with bread and wine.      Salem is the name of ancient Jerusalem.
          See  . Melchizedek was a priest on behalf of whom? Not the Jews, for Abram
          was yet to have a son. Rather, it was on behalf of the gentiles. God established
          a priesthood over the    before he brought forth a priesthood over the
          Jews. Melchizedek was a gentile king over a gentile city. Gentiles have
          been in the heart of God from the beginning.      Bread and wine is the
          substance of the Lord\u2019s Table. Melchizedek brought a Communion service

        content: "  Or \u201CThe boy,\u201D a noun that encompasses a wide age range
          from infancy to young adulthood. Scholars speculate Isaac\u2019s age at
          this time as around twenty; however, Josephus, the Jewish historian, has
          his age at twenty-five (  1.13.2), while others calculate he was thirty-seven.     
          This is the first use of the Hebrew word for worship () in the Bible. Abraham
          freely offered his beloved son to God and called it worship. True worship
          always involves a sacrifice. The first reference in the New Testament to
          worship is found with men bowing down before a child and offering sacrificial
          gifts to Jesus\u2014gold, frankincense, and myrrh. The biblical concept
          of worship includes freely bowing down before God, bringing our gifts (sacrifices
          of praise) to honor and adore him. The Hebrew language has meaning attached
          to every letter, not just every word. Often, the meaning of the word is
          the combination of the meaning of each individual letter. For example,
          the Hebrew word for \u201Cworship\u201D () means \u201Cto bow down in adoration.\u201D
          It\u2019s the combination of only three letters in Hebrew:  .    = \u201Cfiery
          passion.\u201D    = \u201Cjoining with God in a secret place or bridal
          chamber.\u201D    = \u201Cin the presence of God.\u201D Thus, worship could
          be defined as \u201Cexperiencing God\u2019s fiery passion as we come into
          his presence in the bridal chamber.\u201D See Scherman, Nosson/Zlotowitz,
          Meir, Rabbis: Wisdom in the Hebrew Alphabet, 1988, p. 88.      Notice the
          faith of Abraham. He knew that God, if he had to, would resurrect Isaac
          so that both Isaac and his father would return to where they left the servants.

        content: "  Behind the testing of Abraham lies the wisdom of God. Notice
          these four divine principles of God\u2019s tests: (1) When God tests us,
          his requirements of us often make no sense at the time. Therefore, faith
          is needed. Faith yields to God, even when it does not make sense. (2) Faith
          is never brought to maturity without a measure of suffering attached. Even
          Jesus was made perfect through sufferings (see  ;  ;  ). Faith will carry
          you through even the most severe trial. (3) We must obey the Holy Spirit
          even before we know all the details of what is involved. We must be willing
          to not know where God is taking us. Obedience is always one moment, one
          step at a time. (4) Others may not be permitted to know what God is doing
          with us. Abraham left the two servants behind, he left Sarah behind, and
          only he, Isaac, and God would see this test. Often, God will bring you
          to a lonely place where others cannot intrude; they wouldn\u2019t understand
          anyway!    "

          of Eden. Some New Testament scholars believe that it could have been the

          the Holy Spirit, is capable of drawing hearts to the Son, imparting endless
          love for him. Although unnamed here, the servant is elsewhere named Eliezer

        content: "  It is not clear when Abraham took Keturah to be his wife. It
          is possible this happened after the death of Sarah. This would mean that
          he married her when he was more than one hundred and thirty-seven years
          old. (Sarah died at age one hundred and twenty-seven, and Abraham was ten
          years older than Sarah.) The six sons would have been born when Abraham
          was between the ages of one hundred and thirty-seven and one hundred and
          seventy-five. Another possibility is that Abraham had taken Keturah while
          Sarah was still living. The name Keturah may be a variant of a word referring
          to the smoke from a sacrifice or from incense (\u201Csweet smelling smoke\u201D
          or \u201Csweet incense\u201D). Jewish tradition states that Keturah was

          Notice that Isaac reverses the order of the blessing. The fatness of the
          earth was given first because Esau would be a man with his heart attached
          to the world. He would live by the sword-principle, always retaliating
          and unable to forgive. How many believers today have enough of God to get
          by but live with unresolved anger and unforgiveness like Esau? Hebrews
          describes Esau as careless about God\u2019s blessing (see  ). The descendants
          of Esau were known as Edomites. They were a violent people who raided caravans
          and pillaged cities. During David\u2019s reign, the united monarchy dominated
          the Edomites, but they later revolted under the reign of Jehoram (849\u2013842

        content: "  Dreams are a valid form of divine communication in the Bible.
          God frequently spoke to people through dreams. See  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  . On
          the Day of Pentecost, Peter quoted the promise of Joel that those who received
          the Spirit would \u201Cexperience dreams\u201D (; see  ).      The steps
          of this stairway go up into the heavenly realm where our true riches are
          found. Each step is a progressive revelation of God\u2019s purpose for
          our lives found in Jesus Christ. The stairway goes both ways, touching
          heaven and touching earth. Jesus Christ can be thought of as the Stairway
          that reaches from earth (his human nature) to heaven (his heavenly nature).
          Jesus spoke to Nathanael using the same terminology (see  ). Jesus is the
          only valid entry into the spirit-realm, the true way into the heavenly
          realm. By him, we ascend and leave our lower life. This Jesus-Stairway
          was filled with messengers ascending and descending. Who are these messengers?
          Note the order: they ascended first. It does not say they were descending
          and ascending, which would be true if they were the angels in heaven. If
          they ascended first, they were leaving earth to go to heaven. These messengers
          might have been people or divine beings. If people, they were intercessors
          and promise-claimers. The Hebrew word translated \u201Cangel\u201D is 
          , which can also be translated \u201Cambassador,\u201D \u201Cdeputy,\u201D
          \u201Cmessenger,\u201D or \u201Cprophet.\u201D The Greek word used in the
          New Testament for \u201Cangel\u201D is    or \u201Cmessenger.\u201D It
          can refer either to a person or to a heavenly being. Paul wrote to the
          Galatians that they had welcomed him in their midst as if he were an \u201Cangel
          [messenger]\u201D from God (). In  , John was instructed to write to the
          seven churches and to the seven    of those churches. The angels were the
          human overseers of those churches. In  , three angels came to Abraham and
          are described as \u201Cthree men\u201D (cf.  ). We are like angel-ambassadors

          marry Jacob (v.  ). Like many today, she was unable to see clearly, felt

          times in the Jordan River (see  ), parting the Red Sea (see  ), or having
          the sun stand still (see  ). God displayed his creative power through the
          birth of these multicolored young goats. Perhaps the miracle teaches us
          that what we see or gaze upon can impregnate us with the object of our
          vision, for you can determine what you conceive by what you behold. What

          and festivities that could have lasted a week (see  ,  ,  ;  ). Laban was
          preoccupied with the festivities and didn\u2019t realize that his household
          gods had been stolen and that Jacob was secretly taking off with his daughters.     
          This is the Hebrew word  ; they can be described as small, carved figurines

          word meaning \u201Cto inquire.\u201D Apparently, Laban used these images

          meant she took his ability to discover where they had gone (see  ;  ;

          This was the turning point for Jacob. His schemes had all failed, and now
          he faced God alone.      The Hebrew word for \u201Cwrestle\u201D is related
          to a word for \u201Cdust\u201D or \u201Cget dusty,\u201D as two people
          do when wrestling on the ground. There is an amazing play on words in the
          Hebrew between the words \u201Che wrestled\u201D (), \u201CJabbok\u201D
          (), and \u201CJacob\u201D (). The eyes of Jacob could not discern who was
          coming out of the shadows, just as Jacob\u2019s father, Isaac, could not
          discern who it was that received his blessing. It was not Jacob wrestling
          a man, but a Man wrestling with Jacob. The One whom Jacob saw at the top
          of the stairway at Bethel had come down to wrestle with him\u2014and roll
          in the mud of Jacob\u2019s mistakes.    "

          not thorns and snakes. Everyone in the family would be favored. The sheaves
          of grain were Jacob\u2019s sons. They were God\u2019s crop on the earth\u2014a
          ripened, harvested crop. They were stars, bright lights shining in the
          heavens. Instead of provoking his brothers to jealousy, this dream could
          have brought them joy over God\u2019s mercy to them as a family. The second
          dream spoke of government. God informed Joseph through the symbols of the
          sun, moon, and stars that the government would be given to Joseph one day.
          In    the lights of the sky were to \u201Crule\u201D the day and \u201Crule\u201D
          the night. These governing bodies bowing down to Joseph spoke of the great
          authority he would one day be given over his brothers. This second dream
          is much like the vision in  . The woman clothed with the sun signifies
          God\u2019s people (bride), with the moon under her feet and the crown of
          twelve stars on her head. We must see God\u2019s church as ready to give
          birth to a corporate expression of Christ as his Body on the earth. From
          the standpoint of eternity, God sees us all as sheaves full of life and
          stars full of light. Although the sons of Jacob sinned, Christ still came
          through them (see  ;  ). The jealous brothers had no faith in Joseph\u2019s
          dreams, but Jacob, having been broken by God, kept the matter in his heart,
          for even Jacob had received messages from God in dreams.    "

          thieves. At Calvary, the one thief was released (to enter paradise), and
          the other killed. So it was with the two men imprisoned with Joseph, three
          days after they were released! Christ was rejected by his brothers (see 
          ), sold by one of his own (see  ), and eventually cast into the prison
          of death (see  ).    gives us additional information about Joseph\u2019s
          time in prison: \u201CHis feet were bruised by strong shackles and his
          soul was held by iron.\u201D The last phrase can be translated \u201Chis
          soul entered into iron.\u201D The inner strength of loving and serving
          in painful circumstances made Joseph\u2019s soul as strong as iron. He
          learned to serve and to rule over himself first, before God released him
          to rule over others.    "

          Often, prophetic gifts and words of revelation over other people simply
          do not come for the prophet. They are gifts to be used to bless others,
          not for self-consumption. We need others to come with a word for our need.

          He became a slave when he was seventeen years old, and soon afterward,
          Potiphar cast him into prison. Not until he was thirty did Pharaoh release
          him from prison. Thirteen years is a long time to be forgotten. His faith
          in God and the fulfillment of his dreams kept Joseph faithfully waiting
          for his day of promotion. Perhaps, like Joseph, you have been let down
          by others who promised to be a help to you but did not follow through on
          their pledge. Don\u2019t despair, for God will never forget the plans he

          time, he told them that it was God, not they, who orchestrated all the
          events to bring him to the throne. Once painfully betrayed by them, Joseph
          now began to encourage his brothers. His words flowed from a loving, forgiving
          heart, and Joseph\u2019s kindness washed over them. Their guilt was overruled
          by Joseph\u2019s mercy. Through his tears, he convinced them not to dwell
          on their sin but on how God had worked through it all. Joseph had been
          sent by God ahead of them to preserve their lives. Though they did not
          realize it, Joseph\u2019s brothers were helping the Lord fulfill his promise
          to Abraham (see  ). Today, we must learn to see that even those who hurt
          us the most may be those who move us toward the throne. If you see yourself
          in the hands of a loving God, not of others, you will not be offended.

        content: "  Why did Joseph wait for nine years before he sent for his father
          Jacob? He could have sent chariots to Canaan before now, bringing his father
          to Egypt to share his wealth and power. Why did he wait so many years until
          now? Was it because he did not care? No, Joseph cared deeply for his family;
          something else kept him back. Joseph was a man who chose to bear the pain
          of separation from his father rather than run ahead of God. He was an enthroned
          prince, yet he placed God\u2019s interests over his. He knew that the plan
          of God must be fulfilled, not just his own desires. So he waited and waited
          again. Instead of initiating contact with his father and brothers, he stayed
          within the timing of the Lord. Even when it was in his power, Joseph waited
          nine years before his loneliness was removed. The dreams of his youth included
          Jacob, his father, bowing before him also. More than anything else, Joseph
          longed to see his father, but for nine years he did nothing. Even when
          the time came, he himself did not go; he waited until the others brought
          Jacob back. He was restricted to the will of God. This is why Joseph was
          a ruler and a prince. If you are unable to rule yourself, you will not
          be a good ruler over others.  "

          Instead of using their swords for self-defense, they wielded their weapons
          in cruel rage to slaughter and plunder the city of Shechem (see  ). Simeon
          and Levi themselves were not cursed, only their anger. By all accounts,
          Simeon became the fiercest tribe among all of Israel. When Ezekiel described
          the final division of the land, he included a portion for Simeon (see 
          ). His is one of the sealed tribes mentioned in  . There is also a gate
          in the eternal city on which the name Simeon is inscribed (). In the New

          others with God\u2019s Word by writing the books of 1 and 2&nbsp;Peter.
          Concerning Levi, because his natural ways were transformed, he was privileged
          to carry God\u2019s Urim and Thummim as a priest (see  ). The Levites had
          the wonderful privilege of serving God in his presence. Their inheritance
          was not a piece of land (see  ) but the privilege of intimate worship.
          From the story of the Levites, we learn that God can redeem and transform

          Lion of Judah. Jesus Christ is the One who places his omnipotent hand on
          the neck of his enemies and delivers us. The lion, the king of beasts,
          terrifies its prey with his roar. When he seizes his prey, no one can resist
          him. After he has seized his prey, no one pursues him or seeks revenge,
          for the lion is a conqueror. Jacob compared Judah to three kinds of lions:
          a young lion, a mature hunting lion, and a lioness. This is more than a
          prophecy about the tribe of Judah becoming strong and mighty; it is a prophecy
          of One who will come from Judah to devour his prey. Jesus is not a raging
          Lion; he is a resting Lion who has conquered every foe. He crouched and
          took his cross but now lies down in perfect peace. His victory is total
          and secure. Who would dare rouse a lion when he is lying down after his
          kill, and who would rouse a lioness while she is guarding her cubs? These
          three phrases to describe the lion are truly descriptive of what our Savior-King
          has done for us! Jesus came as our Savior: \u201Ca young lion who has devoured
