          divine revelation from God. The Hebrew word    means \u201Cto see spiritually,\u201D
          \u201Cto have a revelation or dream,\u201D or \u201Cto receive an oracle.\u201D
          This word was commonly used to describe how the prophets received divine
          communication.      It is believed that Isaiah was an aristocrat, a member
          of the royal family, and the nephew of King Uzziah. His father, Amoz, was
          the brother of King Amaziah.      Even the names mentioned in v.    have
          something to teach us.    means \u201Cis salvation [victory].\u201D   
          means \u201Cto be made strong or courageous.\u201D    means \u201Cpraise.\u201D
          Jerusalem means \u201Cthe teaching of peace (wholeness).\u201D Isaiah prophesied
          during the reigns of Uzziah (\u201Cthe power of      makes perfect\u201D
          or \u201Cis upright\u201D), Ahaz (\u201Cpossessor\u201D or \u201Cto lay
          hold of\u201D), and Hezekiah (\u201Cstrengthened by    makes firm\u201D).
          Here is what the meanings in the names of v.    teach us: We can see that
          prophetic vision from a courageous prophet imparts the power of    makes
          perfect to maturity. They will be possessors and those who lay hold of
          heaven\u2019s promises until they are strengthened by  and made firm in
          all their ways! All of this will take place in the land of praise and in
          the teaching of peace.    "

          covenant with him. See  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  .      Or \u201Craised them up high

          to grow.\u201D This is what Father God will do for his children. In the
          book of Isaiah, God\u2019s love toward Israel is displayed in a threefold
          way: He is Father (see  ;  ;  ), a nursing Mother (see  ), and a Husband
          (see  ). God was Israel\u2019s Father, Mother, and Husband.      The Hebrew
          word for \u201Crebelled\u201D () indicates the breaking of a contract.
          The covenant Israel entered into with  was broken by their idolatry and
          unbelief. It was as though God\u2019s children disowned their Father.    "

          speaks of our current time in human history between Pentecost and the coming
          again of Christ. See  ;  .      Or \u201Cprepared.\u201D See  .      This
          is a contrast between ch.    and ch.    of Isaiah. No matter how despicable
          our past, God\u2019s grace will fully establish his people as the mountain
          rising above every other mountain. Mountains in the Bible are often used
          metaphorically for kingdoms. Kingdoms and governments are like mountains
          and hills on the landscape of history. The mountain-kingdom of God is in
          view here. It will be the chief of all mountains, the highest of all hills.
          The secular world sees Christ\u2019s kingdom as irrelevant and powerless.
          But one day the kingdoms of the earth will be leveled and the King\u2019s
          mountain will be high and exalted. With no rival, Jesus will sit enthroned.
          This prophetic outlook is the backdrop for all that Isaiah preaches. See 
          ;  .      Or \u201CAll the nations will flow as a river to it.\u201D The
          Hebrew word    can be translated \u201Cstream [river],\u201D \u201Cto sparkle,\u201D
          or \u201Cto be cheerful.\u201D In    it is translated \u201Cradiant.\u201D
          A cheerful, sparkling stream of people will come into divine radiance as
          they come up the mountain of the Lord. This speaks of the uphill flow of
          the river of God\u2014a supernatural magnetism bringing the nations into
          the kingdom of Christ. This is the reversal of the dispersion of the people
          at Babel (see  ).    "

          With the stones, he built a wall of protection around them (). For Israel,
          these stones would represent the Canaanites, those inhabitants of the land
          who made them stumble. Then he planted and established his people, calling
          them the \u201Cchoicest [noblest] of vines,\u201D with everything they
          needed to grow and be fruitful. In  , God\u2019s vineyard is described
          as God\u2019s redeemed people, the church. He has removed our stony hearts
          and given us hearts of flesh to respond to his voice. Throughout the Gospels,
          we see the people of the Lord compared to a vineyard (see  ;  ;  ;  ; 
          ;  ).      For Israel, this watchtower was Jerusalem, the place where the
          owner of the vineyard dwelt and cared for his vineyard. For the church,
          the watchtower is the Zion-realm, the place of God\u2019s presence. He
          not only planted us as his vineyard, but he also dwells among us (see 
          ). The winepress or wine vat is the sacrificial system that God gave to
          his people to provide them with access to himself. For believers today,
          the wine vat is the privilege of open access that the Holy Spirit (our
          wine) provides for us as we gather together.    "

          of    were given before Uzziah\u2019s death in 740 BC. The prophet realized
          that God would judge even a king if he sinned. Isaiah saw the holiness
          of God in the judgment of the leprous king and knew that if his uncle Uzziah
          would be judged, he would be too. When we see the way the Lord deals with
          sin, our eyes are opened and we see him as he really is.      Although
          the word for \u201CLord\u201D here is    (\u201CSovereign\u201D or \u201CMaster\u201D),
          we see from vv.    and    that this is \u201Cthe Lord God, Commander of
          Angel Armies.\u201D Long before Jesus was born, Isaiah saw his glory (see 
          ).      Isaiah mentioned a throne seven times (;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  ). Transported
          into the throne room, Isaiah overheard the solemn chanting of the seraphim.
          He felt the trembling of the very foundations of the temple, and he witnessed
          the rainbow glory-robe of Almighty God. He also saw an altar, a fire with
          burning coals, antiphonal singing, and flying seraphim.      This very
          robe of glory has clothed us in Christ, for we are his temple. When we
          \u201Cput on Christ,\u201D we are robed in his splendor before God and

        content: "  The list of animals in this section represents various attributes
          and spiritual conditions within human beings (cf. Calvin). Some are clean
          and some are unclean; some are wild and some are tame. They typify aspects
          of human nature (e.g., the nature of a wolf, a lamb, a lion, a leopard)
          because elsewhere in Scripture they refer to human beings. Each reveals
          an aspect of the nature of Adam or of the nature of Christ. This figurative
          passage of Scripture points to the subduing power of the life of Christ
          within his people, taming the \u201Cwolf,\u201D the enemy of a lamb (; 
          ), to be subdued and to lie down with the lamb (Christ\u2019s nature within
          us). The Hebrew word for \u201Clamb\u201D () is taken from a root word
          meaning \u201Cto subdue\u201D or \u201Cto dominate.\u201D There are fifteen
          natures (creatures) mentioned in this passage that are reconciled and rest
          together. Fifteen is the number of rest in the Bible.      The leopard
          is mentioned eight times in the Bible, and in every instance, it is used
          figuratively for an aspect of human beings or of spiritual powers of darkness.
          It is emblematic of an aspect of human nature that cannot be changed or
          tamed. See  ;  ;  ;  ;  ;  .      Or \u201Cstretch out.\u201D      Or \u201Ckid,\u201D
          meaning either a male lamb or a male goat (see footnote on  ). The Hebrew
          word for \u201Ckid\u201D () comes from the root word \u201Ccut off.\u201D
          As the Lamb of God, Jesus was cut off from the land of the living for our

        content: "  Tarshish refers most likely to the city of Tartessus, Spain,
          on the Guadalquivir River. Archaeological evidence suggests it may have
          been near present-day Seville.        means \u201Crock,\u201D \u201Ccompressed,\u201D
          or \u201Cpressed together.\u201D Tyre, a Phoenician port on the Mediterranean,
          was once a symbol of power on the sea and a capital of world commerce.
          It was known as wealthy, influential, and evil. Now it is a small village
          known as Sur. Isaiah used it as a metaphor for commerce and trafficking.    "

          of Isaiah. They contain the accounts of three historical events, each surrounding
          the influence of the prophet Isaiah during the reign of Israel\u2019s King
          Hezekiah. This section of Isaiah is frequently called \u201Cthe Volume
          of Hezekiah\u201D since he is mentioned thirty-five times in these four
          chapters. Chapters    detail the unsuccessful efforts of Sennacherib, king
          of Assyria, to take possession of Jerusalem by threats and intimidation.
          Chapter    details Hezekiah\u2019s sickness and miracle of divine healing.
          Chapter    gives us the account of Hezekiah\u2019s sin of pride in showing
          all his wealth to the Babylonian emissaries.      This chapter is recognized
          as a Hebrew poem of rare and superb beauty, one of the most glorious chapters
          in the Bible. It is a picture of the last-days church rising up out of
          the wilderness to shine in all the radiance of its glory. It is a picture
          of Eden restored as the kingdom-realm of God brings hope to the weak and
          struggling. \u201CThe Sacred Way\u201D is the way of life in Christ as
          we live in heaven\u2019s power and virtue.    "

          being crucified. See  . The Hebrew word is  , which is a species of worm
          found in the Middle East () that reproduces itself when the female fastens
          herself to a tree and lays eggs between her body and the tree. When the
          eggs hatch, the baby worms feed on her living body. When the eggs emerge,
          the blood remains on the tree as a crimson stain. When Jesus died on the
          cross (tree), his blood left a crimson stain, and he gave birth to the
          church. He nourishes us and sustains us with his body and blood.      A
          kinsman-redeemer () is a male relative who was culturally responsible to
          act on behalf of a relative who was in trouble or danger, needed to be
          redeemed from slavery, or was in need of rescue. He became like a \u201Csavior\u201D
          or \u201Cfamily protector\u201D for his next of kin. Jesus, our next of
          kin, is our Kinsman-Redeemer. The Hebrew verb    (\u201Cto act as redeemer\u201D)
          is found more than one hundred times in the Hebrew Bible. See  .      Although
          God is holy, he stoops to tenderly help those who feel unholy.    "

          captive to religious systems and to concepts from which Jesus came to set
          us free (see  ,  ). We must always be careful to hear and see and, with
          hearts open to God, receive the new thing God is doing on the earth today.
          Jesus was blind and deaf to doing anything other than the will of his Father.
          God is still restoring his church and making us like Christ, free and full

          the life, crucifixion, and resurrection of our Lord Jesus Christ, apart

          victorious Redeemer, with no hint whatsoever that his activity would be
          interrupted by death. But in this section we find him as the unparalleled
          Suffering Servant and Sin-Bearer who died for us. The prophecy found here
          is the most remarkable in all of the Old Testament of the sufferings of
          Jesus Christ and the glory that followed (see  ).    through    is quoted

          of last-days ministry are found in vv.  : (1) Commit to banish every form
          of oppression in our lives, churches, and society. (2) Remove scornful
          accusation (criticism) of others and their ministries. (3) Forbid to spread

          (5) Comfort those enduring suffering and tragedy. Then God promises (vv. 
          ) that multiple blessings will come: (1) Our spiritual light (influence)
          will increase in our communities. (2) Discouragement and gloom will disappear
          from our lives. (3) God will give us specific guidance and counsel to know
          what to do and where to go. (4) He will fill us with renewing grace, even

          will flourish like a lush garden with fruit and beauty. (6) We will not
          cease to be an ever-flowing source of blessing to others. (7) We will be
          given God\u2019s grace to rebuild lives and institutions in our cities,

          archetype of that which stands in God\u2019s way. It is possible, since

          of the Jews and typify the warfare of the flesh versus the spirit (see

        content: "  The \u201Cday of vengeance\u201D has multiple applications. It
          can refer to the release of the Jews from Babylon, the release of the church
          from the Dark Ages, the release of creation from the bondage of corruption
          brought by sin (see  ), or, as some would claim, the future battle of Armageddon.
          But the context favors an interpretation that this prophecy was fulfilled
          when Jesus Christ was crucified and rendered judgment on principalities
          and powers by the blood of his cross and his triumphant resurrection.    "
