        content: "  The book of Joshua begins with the word \u201CAnd.\u201D What
          writer uses the connective \u201CAnd\u201D to start a new production? This
          indicates the close connection between the books of Deuteronomy and Joshua.
          In the Hebrew text every book from Joshua through 2&nbsp;Kings (with the
          exception of Ruth) begins with \u201CAnd,\u201D demonstrating that the
          history of Israel is one connected narrative and inspired by one divine
          author, the Holy Spirit.      Jewish tradition states that Moses died on
          the seventh of Adar, the twelfth month of the Jewish calendar. The book
          of Joshua takes up the story right after the thirty-day mourning period
          for Moses (see  ). Leaders may die, but God\u2019s prophetic promises live
          on.      Joshua is the name Moses gave him, changing it from Hoshea to
          Joshua (), which means \u201Cis salvation,\u201D \u201Cmay  save,\u201D
          \u201Cmakes triumphant,\u201D or \u201Cis the Deliverer.\u201D        means
          \u201Ceternal,\u201D \u201Cperpetual,\u201D \u201Cto re-sprout,\u201D or
          \u201Ceternal increase.\u201D Joshua was the son of Nun. One greater than
          Joshua is Jesus, Son of the Eternal God. Joshua is introduced into the
          story as the \u201Cson of Nun.\u201D In western culture we are identified
          by our profession, by what we do or have accomplished. But in Hebrew culture,
          we are introduced in the language of sonship\u2014as a son or daughter.
          In English, we, too, use patronyms to identify persons, which is nearly
          the same as \u201Cson of.\u201D      Seventeen times in Joshua we read
          the words \u201Cspoke to Joshua\u201D or \u201Csaid.\u201D Perhaps it was
          through an audible voice, in a dream, in a vision, in a divine encounter,
          through a prophecy, through the Urim and Thummim (see  ), or by some other
          way. God has multiple ways of speaking to his servants.    "

          into judgment for our sins and rolled the river of guilt, shame, and judgment

          to enter our own spiritual \u201Cpromised land\u201D to claim our endless
          spiritual blessings (see  ). First, we cross over into a new day, burying

          Jesus (Joshua), cutting off flesh, experiencing the circumcision of the

          sin and victory over our enemies (see  ). Fourth, we get a new diet for
          conquerors (see  ). Manna (the life of Christ while he was on earth) has
          ceased, and the new roasted grain has become our feast. Jesus passed through
          the fires of God\u2019s judgment for our sins and has now become the grain
          of wheat who fell into the ground (see  ). Now he is raised with many grains

          a war cry or a shout of joy.      The walled city of Jericho could represent
          the stronghold of the natural mind and every high thought that exalts itself
          against the knowledge of the true God (see  ). Walls represent our inner
          \u201Cwalls\u201D and arguments we erect against learning something new.
          The mind of man is opposed to the ways of God (see  ;  ). The door to truth
          is not the intellect but rather the spirit yielded to God. Daniel saw the
          writing on the wall, and knew the walls of Babylon would fall (see  , 
          ). Ezekiel dug through the \u201Cwall\u201D to uncover the abominations
          that were hidden (). The prophet Joel saw an army that would run upon and
          climb up the \u201Cwalls\u201D (). David was a champion who leapt over
          the \u201Cwall\u201D (; see  ). And similarly, Joshua was a prophetic leader
          who shouted so that the \u201Cwalls\u201D could topple ().      The perimeter
          of Jericho was about four miles. God designed this unorthodox military
          strategy to demonstrate his power (see  ), to discourage all forms of self-reliance,
          and to bring all the glory to himself (see  ). The thick, impenetrable
          walls (see  ;  ) were nothing against the power of God!    "

          God; it was because there was sin in the camp of Israel and they had lost
          God\u2019s favor. Although it was one individual, Achan, who sinned, God
          viewed them as a unit. We are one body in Christ, and the victory of one
          is the victory of all, and the sin of one is the sin of all. See  . For
          the righteousness of one (Rahab), the whole of her family was saved. For
          the sin of Achan, the whole of his family was condemned. Thus it is imperative
          that we belong firmly to the family of God in Christ Jesus, our eldest
          brother and representative head.    "

          Furthermore, cutting wood and carrying water would be very important tasks

          Jesus (our Joshua) set guardians over the church (see  ;  ). Jesus pounds

          Israel: Gilgal, Shiloh, and Shechem. Gilgal was their military headquarters
          during the invasion. For the believer today, Gilgal represents our beginning,
          our resurrection into new life, and our responsibilities and battles that
          come with it (see  ;  ). Gilgal was also a place of recovery and renewal,
          for the reproach of Egypt was rolled away at Gilgal. Shiloh was the pre-Jerusalem
          capitol and worship center for Israel, the spiritual pivot of national
          life. That is where God had manifested his grace, guidance, and power.
          It represents the holy realm of worship and devotion to God, where we receive
          divine revelation. Shechem was the political cradle of the nation due to
          its importance in the lives of the patriarchs. Shechem was not only the
          geographic center of Canaan but also the moral heart of the nation. At
          this city Abraham built the first altar to  within the land, and here God
          appeared to him and promised that Abraham\u2019s seed would inherit the
          promises (see  ). It is the place of building altars, renewing our covenant-love
