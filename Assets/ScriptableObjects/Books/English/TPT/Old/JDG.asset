          speaking his name and the name of his father. Not only does God know your
          name, but so does the enemy, for you are a son or daughter of God! Gideon
          used this fear tactic when he instructed his three hundred men to shout
          both the name of  and the name of Gideon. It was the Lord who gave this
          plan to Gideon.      God gave a heathen man a dream, and he gave the interpretation
          to his friend. God has a thousand ways to deliver us and bring us victory.    '

          or \u201Cworm.\u201D The dried body of the female worm    was crushed (see 
          ) and then used to dye clothing scarlet or crimson. In those days, scarlet
          cloth was highly valued (). Exodus mentions \u201Cscarlet\u201D twenty-six
          times referring to materials of the tabernacle. In  , the psalm of the
          cross, Jesus identified himself as  , \u201Ca&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. worm\u201D
          (v.  ). Although it can be translated \u201Cworm,\u201D Jesus was saying
          that he was like the worm that bleeds scarlet, changing the very substance
          of those his blood touches. \u201CWhen the female of the scarlet [\u2018tola\u2019]
          worm species was ready to give birth to her young, she would attach her
          body to the trunk of a tree, fixing herself so firmly and permanently that
          she would never leave again. The eggs deposited beneath her body were thus
          protected until the larvae were hatched and able to enter their own life
          cycle. As the mother died, the crimson fluid stained her body and the surrounding
          wood. From the dead bodies of such female scarlet worms, the commercial
          scarlet dyes of antiquity were extracted\u201D (Biblical Basis for Modern
          Science, p. 73, 1985, Henry Morris). The tola worm left a scarlet stain
          on the tree to which it attached itself, but after three days, the scarlet
          stain turned white. See  . Tola is a preview of our splendid Jesus who
          was like a crushed worm that bled scarlet.        means \u201Csplendid.\u201D       
          comes from the root word for \u201Cbeloved\u201D or \u201Clover.\u201D
          In Tola we see Jesus, who is now the Lover of our soul.        means \u201Csharp
          point [thorn].\u201D Jewish tradition states that God created the shamir
          stone as the means by which Moses engraved the names of the twelve tribes
          onto the stones of the breastplate. (See Tosefta, So\u1E6Dah, xv. 1 [ed.
          Zuckermandel, p. 321]; So\u1E6Dah 48b; Yer. So\u1E6Dah 24b.) Other traditions
          hold that shamir was a very small worm that could bore into stone. (See
          Rashi, Pes. 54a, Gr\xFCnbaum [\u201CGesammelte Aufs\xE4tze,\u201D p. 32];
