          It is a wild and passionate song. Have you ever been under such pressure
          that you felt like roaring? That is a \u201Cshiggaion.\u201D Some scholars
          believe the central thought of the word is that of wandering. It may also

          Cush means \u201Cfirelike,\u201D \u201Cburned,\u201D or \u201Cblackened.\u201D

          from the root word  , which is also the Hebrew word for \u201Cbest friend.\u201D
          This translation includes both meanings. The unique term for shepherd is 
          \u2014\u201Clover of the flock.\u201D This teaches us that a shepherd was
          not just a responsible overseer, but a caring father figure, tending to
          his flock out of a deep sense of love. Shepherds were also fierce protectors
          of their flocks. Jesus is the Fierce Protector of his people.      Or \u201CI
          lack nothing.\u201D What a wonderful declaration over your life! To never
          be in lack, always possessing more than enough. Our God meets our emotional,
          physical, and spiritual needs.    "

        content: "  A temple had not yet been built when David wrote this psalm.
          He was saying that he longs to be surrounded with God\u2019s presence,
          enclosed and encircled with holiness.      The meaning of the Hebrew word
          for \u201Cbeauty\u201D () is not easily conveyed by one English word. It
          can also be translated \u201Csweetness,\u201D \u201Cpleasantness,\u201D
          \u201Cfriendliness,\u201D \u201Cgraciousness,\u201D \u201Cgoodness,\u201D
          \u201Cloveliness,\u201D \u201Csplendor,\u201D or \u201Cdelightfulness.\u201D
          Take each of these terms and read the verse again, inserting the possible
          alternatives. We must be captured by the awesomeness of God each time we
          come before him and rejoice in his friendship.      The Hebrew verb   
          can also mean \u201Cinquire,\u201D \u201Cmeditate,\u201D \u201Ctake pleasure
          in,\u201D and, in a general sense, \u201Cworship,\u201D \u201Cpray,\u201D
          or \u201Cseek [guidance].\u201D However,    comes from a root word that
          means \u201Cto arise at dawn.\u201D Perhaps David was saying that he would
          arise every dawn to take pleasure in God.    "

        content: "  Ancient expositors viewed the \u201Cpelican in the wilderness\u201D
          as a reference to Christ. The famous legend and much medieval artwork taught
          that the pelican would give the gift of blood to her starving young by
          piercing her own breast with her beak, allowing her young to drink her
          blood and live. What an amazing example of sacrificial love. Augustine
          writes concerning this: \u201CThe mother wounds herself deeply and pours
          forth her blood over her young, bathed in which they recover life.\u201D
          See Augustine, \u201CExposition on the Book of Psalms,\u201D in  , ed.

        stanza begins with the same Hebrew letter at the beginning of every one of
        its eight lines, going in succession, by strophes, fromalef\u2014the first
        letter of the Hebrew alphabet, as the first letter of each line in the first
        strophe\u2014totaw\u2014the last letter of the Hebrew alphabet, as the first
        letter of each line in the last strophe. Like the eight lines of each stanza,
        there are eight Hebrew words, all synonyms, used to refer to the Word of
        God. Although many believe Ezra wrotePs. 119, the acrostic poetic style is
        unique to King David within the book of Psalms, which points to his authorship

          It is likely these fifteen songs were sung on the fifteen steps that would

          and sing the corresponding psalm as they went up ever higher into the temple
          to worship God. Others believe they were the songs sung as David brought
          up the ark of glory to Jerusalem. They are also known as \u201CSongs of
