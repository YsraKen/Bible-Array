          chs.  , with the theme of the renewal of historical land boundaries in

          the land of the Chaldeans,\u201D that is, the land of Babylonia. The Chaldeans
          were an Aramean people group assimilated into Babylonia. Ezekiel saw his
          visions in Babylon, perhaps near the place of the ruins of the Tower of
          Babel. In the place of man\u2019s greatest rebellion and where languages
          divided the human race, Ezekiel saw the glory of God.      Chebar has been
          identified with the river Habor, the Chaboras, or modern Khabur, which
          flows into the Euphrates at Circesium. The community of exiles was apparently
          known as Tel Abib (see  ). The word    means \u201Cpowerful,\u201D \u201Cmany,\u201D
          or \u201Cstrong.\u201D This river indicates that Babylon was strong and
          powerful. The tide of this fallen world system is indeed strong and powerful,
          taking many away from the knowledge of God. But there is another river
          in Ezekiel, the River of God (see ch.  ) that brings the life-giving knowledge
          of God to the earth. One river keeps people in captivity; the other river
          brings life and freedom.      Or literally \u201Cin the thirtieth year.\u201D
          There is much debate among scholars over what was the \u201Cthirtieth year.\u201D
          Was it the thirtieth year from the time when Hilkiah the high priest found
          the book of the law in the temple (see  )? Was it during the thirtieth
          Jubilee of Jewish history? The church father Origen and others argue that
          the vision came to Ezekiel when he was thirty years old (for a summary
          of opinions, see Julius A. Bewer, \u201CThe Text of Ezekiel 1:1\u20133,\u201D   
          50, no. 2 [Jan. 1934]: 96\u2013101). Regardless, the number thirty is especially
          important biblically; it is the number of full maturity. When a descendant
          of Aaron turned thirty, he was then eligible to become a priest. Both Jesus
          and John the Baptizer began their ministries when they were thirty. Joseph,
          who is perhaps the clearest type of Jesus in the Old Testament, came to
          stand before Pharaoh at thirty years of age (see  ). Ezekiel likely was
          disappointed he could not serve  as his priest, for there was no more temple
          worship. Instead,  chose Ezekiel to be his prophet in the year he would
          have qualified to be a priest. In a sense, Ezekiel became like a \u201Chigh
          priest\u201D to the exiles. A high priest was forbidden to mourn publicly
          the death of his wife (see  ;  ).      Scholars surmise that this date
          was July 31, 593 BC. So, we can conclude that Ezekiel was twenty-five years
          old when he went into captivity and thirty years old when he experienced
          this vision.    tells us that priests began their ministry at the age of
          thirty; however,    says that the Levites began to serve as apprentices
          at the age of twenty-five. They needed to be trained and taught for five
          years prior to entering the priesthood. Even in captivity, God\u2019s grace
          trained Ezekiel so that he would be a prophet-priest before God and people.     
          This Hebrew clause begins with the double verb    in the form of an infinitive

          a greater, more strengthened sense of meaning. This statement makes very
          clear that what is about to be revealed to Ezekiel is of the utmost importance.

          ago.\u201D The One greater than Ezekiel, Jesus, also saw the heavens open
          at the Jordan River when he was thirty (see  ).      This is the same self-replenishing
          flame that Moses saw before the sacred shrub. This is the all-consuming
          fire of        Ezekiel was witnessing the phenomenon of the glory cloud
          of God, the Shekinah, which envelopes God himself coming to the earth (see 
          ;  ). God was in the blowing wind and in the overshadowing cloud. Moses
          stayed in this cloud of glory for forty days (see  ); perhaps Ezekiel did

          or \u201Cappearance\u201D? Because the eye conveys more than the concept
          of \u201Csomething like.\u201D The eye speaks of clear vision and of the
          twinkling or sparkling of the eye.      Although the word    is not frequently
          used today, it is, in fact, the best description of what Ezekiel saw. Electrum
          is the fusion of gold (a symbol of deity) and silver (a symbol of redemption)
          into a bright metal alloy. The Hebrew word for \u201Celectrum\u201D is

        content: "  From the beginning, the earliest writings of our church fathers
          taught that the four living creatures represent the four gospels, including
          the writings of Irenaeus, Epiphanius of Salamis, Jerome, Gregory the Great,
          Hippolytus, Augustine, and others. The faces of the living creatures are
          mentioned eleven times in this chapter. The face of a man suggests human
          compassion and understanding for others (see  ). From whichever direction
          a person looked at the group of the living creatures, it was the human
          face looking at them. And it was the human face that was facing the direction
          in which the whole group went (). Luke\u2019s Gospel highlights Jesus\u2019
          compassionate humanity and is the parallel to the human face here.     
          The face of a lion suggests kingship, strength, and fearless boldness in
          the face of obstacles and opposition (see  ). Matthew\u2019s Gospel brings
          before us the kingly role of Jesus, the Messiah. The lion\u2019s face is
          seen in the Lion of Judah\u2019s tribe. When you look past the frail humanity
          of others and choose not to be offended, you imitate the lion\u2019s face.     
          The face of an ox suggests patient, enduring service, even in weariness
          (see  ). An ox goes to work when called upon, whether it feels like it
          or not. Mark\u2019s Gospel presents the Son of Man as the servant of God
          and one who humbly served humanity. The ox\u2019s face is seen in the servant
          of  who carries our burdens.      The face of an eagle suggests living
          in a high spiritual place, able to soar above the things of the world (see 
          ). John\u2019s Gospel presents the eagle of eternity, one who came from
          above and ascended on high. An eagle\u2019s face is seen in Jesus, the
          heavenly Man. Each creature (animal) is a \u201Cking.\u201D The eagle is
          the king of birds. The ox is the king of domesticated animals. The lion
          is the king of the beasts. And man is the king of creation, made in the
          image and likeness of God. These four living creatures can be seen in two
          dimensions. First, as pointing to Jesus Christ, King of kings, and second,
          as the body of Christ on earth, the new creation man (see  ).    "

          power of the living creatures was in the wheels. The power of the life
          of the believer is Christ in us. The wheel inside a wheel can be a metaphor
          for Christ in us, a divine wheel inside a wheel, even as the Father was

          speaking to them, but their prophecies were meant to deceive their followers
          (see vv.  ). (6) They refused to expose sin (see vv.  ) and prophesied
          delusions. (7) They preached a message of peace and protection when, in
          fact, disastrous judgment was imminent (see vv.  ). (8) Their lies provoked
          God\u2019s anger and brought judgment upon them (see vv.  ,  ). (9) They
          were not prophesying by the Spirit of God but, instead, used witchcraft

          its description of the harlotry of Israel (Jerusalem). It is an expressive
          parable of God\u2019s queen (see v.  ) becoming a prostitute (see v.  ).
          Idolatry in God\u2019s eyes is like the unfaithfulness of a wife to her
          husband. The language is so scandalous and jarring that according to the
          Mishnah (oral Torah), it should never be read in public. Modern readers
          will find this chapter full of terms and phrases that are sexually expressive
          and vulgar, so much so that most modern translations soften the text to
          help lessen its jolt to our senses. For the most part, the translation
          team has kept the expressive language as it is stated in the Hebrew text.
          So, why did God speak so vulgarly to Jerusalem? To shock her out of her
          complacency and deception. Thankfully, the chapter ends with a promise
          of grace and restoration (see vv.  ).    "

          The people were quoting this parable because they felt that God was treating
          them unfairly. They were taken into captivity and lost their homes and
          land, and they did not think that they deserved to be punished in that
          way. The basis of this belief is found in  ;  . This fatalistic attitude
          left the people of Israel feeling like they had no control over their lives,
          and it no longer mattered how they lived. Even if they were good, they
          believed God would punish them for their parents\u2019 evil. In effect,

          terrible will be the destruction of Jerusalem. The Hebrew word for \u201Cruin\u201D
          () is a play on the word for \u201Cguilt\u201D or \u201Cpunishment\u201D
          () in vv.  .      Who is this \u201Crightful ruler\u201D? Some believe
          the rightful ruler was Jehoiachin, previously dethroned. Some see it as
          a reference to Nebuchadnezzar, whom God was using to punish Jerusalem,
          or as perhaps a cryptic reference to the future Messiah, our Lord Jesus.
          See  .      Jesus Christ is the one who has the right to wear the \u201Cturban\u201D
          of vv.    (as our High Priest) and the \u201Ccrown\u201D (as the King).
          He is the one who initiated the King-Priest ministry after the order of
          Melchizedek. And he has made us part of his King-Priest ministry on earth.

          of judgment against the nations. This section contains the climactic oracle
          of judgment against the nation of Tyre. In Ezekiel\u2019s prophecy, Tyre
          is the embodiment of blasphemous arrogance, the personification of satanic
          pride\u2014the quintessential heart of idolatry. Panel K is the central
          panel, or locus, of the chiasmus as it demonstrates the climactic judgment
          of  against the most godless of nations at the time of Ezekiel. This judgment
          marks the turning point of the prophecy in that it highlights the pinnacle
          of God\u2019s anger against gross idolatry and rebellion against  \u2014),
          chs.    (panels I  through A) emphasize the glorious provisions of God\u2019s
          promised renewal, spiritual transformation, and everlasting forgiveness
          of sin, encapsulated in the provisions of the coming new covenant and the
          certainty of the promise of the arrival of the Messiah, Jesus Christ, the
          Son of God, on earth. Chapters    contain prophecies of judgment against
          Tyre. The city of Tyre was a prosperous commercial center situated north
          of Israel on an island in the Mediterranean Sea just off the coast of Phoenicia
          (see  ). Tyre and her sister city, Sidon, had significant influence on
          the Northern Kingdom of Israel. Jezebel, wife of Ahab, came from Tyre (see 
          ). Tyre was a city of trade and commerce. Hiram, king of Tyre, was a devoted
          friend to King David (see  ) and helped him and King Solomon in their building
          operations (see  ;  ;  ,  ). The god of Tyre was Melkart, an idol with
          hands outstretched to receive human blood. Located today in modern Lebanon,
          Tyre has become a historical example of what happens to a people that mock
          Israel\u2019s God. Tyre\u2019s worldwide trading empire represents the
          principle of the love of money, trafficking, and merchandising\u2014the
          pride of the satanic world system.      The dating of this prophecy is
          incomplete because it does not specify what month of the year. Some translations
          leave a gap, assuming it is missing from the manuscripts. It is difficult
          to know what month Ezekiel received this prophecy; however, Jewish scholars
          conclude it was the fifth month since it was the month that Jerusalem fell.    "

        content: "  The prophecy in the following verses details the judgment of
          the king of Tyre, who, according to Phoenician annals and the Jewish historian
          Josephus, was Ithobalus II. Ezekiel prophesied his judgment as though it
          had already happened. Although Ezekiel was giving a prophecy over a literal
          king, he was dealing with the spiritual principality of Tyre, not simply
          a man. This chapter can be interpreted figuratively since it does not entirely
          apply to a human king. This is recognized as a difficult text that inspired
          diverse interpretations. According to rabbinic tradition, the prophecy
          speaks of the fall of the first man, Adam, while the church fathers found
          in the same text a description of the fall of Lucifer. The first half of
          Ezekiel\u2019s prophecy (vv.  ) seems to refer to a human (Adam) while
          the second half (vv.  ) seems to refer to Satan (Lucifer). Verses    are
          addressed to the \u201Cprince of Tyre\u201D while verses    are addressed
          to the \u201Cking of Tyre.\u201D For a detailed study of this chapter,

          It deals with the theme of Ezekiel as a \u201Cwatchman\u201D for the house
          of Israel. This chapter serves as a contrasting parallel with ch.  \u2014the
          \u201Ccooking pot\u201D judgment on Jerusalem (i.e., panel I).      Starting
          with this chapter and for the rest of the book, Ezekiel gives prophecies
          that look forward to the restoration of Israel. Although ch.    repeats
          some of the themes of judgment, it remains a pivotal chapter in the book.
          While Jerusalem was still standing, Ezekiel\u2019s message was mostly negative
          and corrective, for the people felt like they were safe as long as the
          temple stood in Jerusalem. But after Jerusalem\u2019s fall and the people\u2019s
          hopes were shattered, Ezekiel began to encourage them and prophesy hope
          for the future. Sinful people and sinful nations must lose their false
          hopes before they (we) are ready to hear the true way of trusting God alone
          for our future.    "

          It deals with the metaphorical theme of shepherds and sheep, with two distinct
          applications. The first of these focuses on the corrupt and godless leaders
          of Israel\u2014the heartless and cruel \u201Cshepherds of Israel\u201D
          who brutalize their \u201Cflock\u201D (vv.  ). The second application of
          the metaphor focuses on  as the quintessential \u201Cgood shepherd,\u201D
          who nurtures and lovingly cares for his people, his \u201Cflock\u201D (vv. 
          ).  will also provide a legacy of godly leaders for the future, via the
          spiritual descendants of King David. This metaphor is taken up by Jesus
          in  , where he declared himself the ultimate \u201CGood Shepherd\u201D
          (), caring for all those followers God, his Father, gives him. This chapter
          serves as a contrasting parallel with    (panel H), a metaphorical allegory
          of the two adulterous sisters, identifying them with the godless and immoral
          kingdoms of Israel and Judah.    "

          stealing his brother Esau\u2019s birthright. The Edomites were descendants
          of Esau and viewed the Israelites as illegitimate usurpers who took over
          the land. The Edomites frequently sought revenge against Israel and hated
          the Israelites. Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Obadiah likewise denounced Edom.
          Symbolically, Edom represents the old nature of Adam that must be removed,
          crucified with Christ, before the glories of the new covenant can be manifested.

          bones was likely an ecstatic vision that showed the prophet the utter devastation

          promise is that he will revive his people and bring them back to life.

          dry bones speak of hope, not defeat. The \u201Cskeletons in your closet\u201D

          The Talmud teaches that these scattered bones were the bones of the young
          Hebrew men that King Nebuchadnezzar had executed. Apparently, the Jewish
          young men taken into captivity were so handsome that the Babylonian women
          were falling head over heels for them. So, Nebuchadnezzar had them executed,
          their bodies mutilated, and their bones scattered. The Talmud also teaches
          that this was not only a vision but reality as well. God instructed Ezekiel
          to speak to these dry bones and they would come together and live again.
          Not only was this a prophetic sign, but, according to Talmudic literature,
          it actually took place as these now resurrected men went on to marry and
          live out a full life. See  .    '

          Various theories have been proposed over the identity of Gog. Some identify

          view Gog as a symbol for the Babylonian monarch, whose destruction was

          These chapters contain the visionary plans for the ideal temple, providing
          the perfect environment for Israel\u2019s godly leaders in the new covenant
          age. These chapters then serve as a striking contrasting parallel with
          chs.    (panel C\u2014specifically,  ), which deal with the corruption
          of Israel\u2019s leaders and their condemnation and judgment. There is
          also here the implied desecration and destruction of the Jerusalem temple,
          along with the promised destruction of all cities and towns in the land
          (see  ). The final nine chapters are truly the culmination of the entire
          book. They detail the final restoration of Israel and the restored temple
          that brings blessing and life to the nations. To read Ezekiel without these
          last chapters is to miss the overarching message of hope, not judgment.
          Chapters    give us the details of the new temple and its courtyards. Chapter   
          shows God returning to dwell within his new temple, in the same way he
          left the old temple in ch.  . Ezekiel begins and ends with a vision of
          God\u2019s glory. For more on Ezekiel\u2019s Temple, see \u201CInterpreting
          Ezekiel\u2019s Temple\u201D in the introduction.      The date of this
          chapter is probably September\u2013October 573 BC. Some Jewish scholars
          believe that this was a Jubilee year (see  ), when the enslaved were given
          freedom and debts were canceled. Perhaps as it was \u201Cthe tenth day
          of the month\u201D this was also the Day of Atonement (see  ).      Or

          difficulties including discrepancies and contradictions to the law found
          in the Pentateuch. The Rabbis of the Talmud (Menahot 45a) have stated that
          only Elijah himself would be able to decipher these difficulties when he
          comes. Additionally, it is difficult to be precise in the length of a cubit.
          Generally, a standard cubit is believed to be about 17.5 inches or 0.44
          meters. A long cubit was a cubit plus a handbreadth (3.5 inches or 90 millimeters);
          in total about 21 inches or 0.53 meters. Unless otherwise noted, conversions
          from cubits to modern units in this translation will be calculated using
          the long cubit measurement. Based on this, the length of the measuring
          reed would be about 10.5 feet (3.2 meters).    "

        content: "  This verse illustrates a significant interpretive feature of
          this vision, namely, that it is not a picture of ecological perfection.
          The statement that the swamps and marshes will not be purified by the remarkable
          river flowing down from the Jerusalem temple but will be left as stagnant
          pools, polluted by excessive salt, reflects a less than perfect renewal.
          Now, while this vision describes a truly remarkable transformation of the
          land of promise, and the ecological purification of the Dead Sea, it is
          incomplete. The language of this vision is couched in terms of revived
          natural vegetation, ecology, and wildlife\u2014marine creatures in particular\u2014but
          the full realization of this divine transformation will not come about
          until the return of the Lord Jesus. And that vision is given to us in the

          the full and perfect consummation of God\u2019s redemptive plans and purposes
          for his people is revealed. And significantly, while explicit images of
          Ezekiel\u2019s vision are retained in  , the full import of John\u2019s
