        content: "  To enter the doorway of Jesus\u2019 heart we must begin by saying,
          \u201CLet him.\u201D We only bring him a yielded heart and must \u201Clet
          him\u201D do the rest. God\u2019s loving grace means that he will be enough
          for us. We can \u201Clet him\u201D be everything to us. We don\u2019t begin
          by doing but by yielding.      This Spirit-kiss is what made Adam, the
          man of clay, into a living expression of God. Dust and deity met when the
          Maker kissed his Spirit-Wind into Adam. The Word of God is the kiss from
          the mouth of our Beloved, breathing upon us the revelation of his love.
          The Shulamite doesn\u2019t ask him for power, position, or promotion, but
          for a kiss. Intimacy with Jesus Christ is more important than anything
          else he can give us.      Or \u201Cyour breasts\u201D or \u201Cyour loves.\u201D
          This speaks of his saving love, keeping love, forgiving love, and embracing
          love. The love of Jesus cannot be singular; it is so infinite it must be
          described in the plural.      There is a wordplay in the Hebrew, similar
          to a pun. The word for \u201Ckisses\u201D and the word for \u201Ctake a
          drink [wine]\u201D is nearly the same. The implication, as seen by ancient
          expositors, is that God\u2019s lovers will be drunk with love, the intoxicating
          kisses of his mouth. The Hebrew word for \u201Ckiss\u201D is  , which can
          also mean \u201Cto equip\u201D or \u201Cto arm (for battle).\u201D We need
          his kisses to become equipped warriors for him.    "

          seven times in the Song of Songs (,  ,  ;  ,  ,  ,  ). The Hebrew root
          word for \u201Crejoice\u201D () is a homonym for \u201Cspinning in a circle
          or dance.\u201D The implication is that we dance for joy when we remember
          his love.      The kiss of God pours out blessing over our hearts. It is
          the warmth of his love that convinces us that his heart is turned forever
          toward us. The most common word for worship in the New Testament is  ,
          which means to fall on your knees before him to kiss him. Our worship,
          with deep affection, is his reward.    "

          to describe the Shulamite, and three times she is called    (the most beautiful
          of women). Eight times her beauty is extolled. Eight is the number for
          new creation life. Hebrew linguists link this word for \u201Cbeauty\u201D
          to  , which means \u201Cto radiate,\u201D \u201Cto burst forth,\u201D or
          \u201Cto emerge from darkness to project beauty.\u201D It is also related

          The number one thousand is a biblical symbol for the glory of God. The
          prize of mature sonship is a truth that defies description, and all the
          glory of the vineyard belongs to our King, one greater than Solomon.     
          Or \u201Cthe two hundred.\u201D This is two times one hundred. The number
          one hundred represents the children of the promise. Abraham was one hundred
          when Isaac, the promised seed, was born (). Isaac was a type of the children
          of promise, the spiritual seed (;  ). The number one hundred is also connected
          to Isaac\u2019s sowing and reaping, and the blessing of God (). The Lord
          will receive the hundred-fold fruit of his life in us (). Jesus has one
          hundred sheep in his fold (). The number two is the symbol of witness.
          Two hundred reveals the witness of God\u2019s sons coming forth ().  "
