        content: "  As stated in the introduction, the Hebrew word for \u201Cproverbs\u201D
          means more than just a wise saying. It can also mean \u201Cto rule, to
          reign in power, to take dominion.\u201D      The name Solomon means \u201Cpeaceable.\u201D
          There is a greater one than Solomon who gives peace to all of his followers.
          His name is Jesus. Solomon was the seed of David; we are the seed of Jesus
          Christ. Solomon had an encounter with God after asking for a discerning
          heart (). This pleased God, so he gave Solomon wisdom, riches, and power.
          God is ready to impart these same things today to those who ask him. See 
          .    "

          the meaning. The word used here is  , and it is used in Proverbs forty-two
          times. Forty-two is the number of months Jesus ministered and the number

      number: 7
      content: We cross the threshold of true knowledgewhen we live in obedient devotion
        to God. [[COMMENT(0)]]Stubborn know-it-alls  will never stop to do this,for
        they scorn true wisdom and knowledge.
      comments:
      - number: 1:7
        content: "  Many translations render this \u201Cthe fear of the Lord.\u201D
          This means much more than the English concept of fear. It also implies
          submission, awe, worship, and reverence. The Hebrew word used here is found
          fourteen times in Proverbs. The number fourteen represents spiritual perfection.
          The number fourteen is mentioned three times in the genealogy of Jesus
          (). It is also the number for Passover. You will pass from darkness to
          wisdom\u2019s light by the \u201Cfear\u201D of the Lord.      Or \u201Cfoolish
          ones.\u201D There are three Hebrew words translated \u201Cfool\u201D in
          Proverbs and another six that are related to a fool or foolish acts. A
          fool is described in Proverbs as one who hates true wisdom and correction,
          with no desire to acquire revelation knowledge.    "

          young anointed ones to come to her \u201Cbed\u201D of compromise (see

        content: "  This parable (vv.  ) not only warns against the obvious evils
          of adultery and immorality, but also serves as a warning to the anointed
          young men in ministry not to be seduced by the religious system. Wisdom
          looks from the window (revelation and insight\u2014see  ) of her house
          (the true church of Jesus) and sees a young man (not fully mature\u2014see 
          ) who has placed himself in the path of sin. This made him vulnerable to
          the seduction of the \u201Charlot\u201D system of a works-based religion
          that enticed him into her bed (partnership, covering, and ordination with
          her and her system\u2014see  ) covered with Egyptian linens (Egypt is a
          picture of the world system that holds people in bondage). She is loud
          and stubborn (the old self-life never dealt with) and will not remain in
          her house (the true church of Jesus). She lives in the darkness of compromise
          and her ways are the ways of death. She doesn\u2019t remain faithful to
          her husband (the Bridegroom-God). The two women of Proverbs are the harlot
          mentioned here and the virtuous woman found in chapter  , who speak of
          two systems of worship. One is true and virtuous; the other is false and
          seductive.  "

        content: "  This section of Proverbs is attributed to Agur, who gave these
          oracles to his prot\xE9g\xE9s Ithiel and Ukal. Agur means \u201Cto gather
          a harvest.\u201D He was the son of Jakeh, which means \u201Cblameless\u201D
          or \u201Cobedient.\u201D Jakeh could be another name for David, Solomon\u2019s
          father. Many Jewish expositors believe that Agur was a pseudonym for Solomon.
          Nothing more is mentioned about Agur in the Bible than what we have here,
          which is typical for other prophets mentioned in the Scriptures. Some believe
          he could be the \u201Cmaster of the collection of sayings\u201D referred
          to in  .      Or \u201Cmighty prophecy.\u201D      The name Ithiel can
          mean \u201CGod is with me\u201D or \u201CGod has arrived.\u201D This was
          fulfilled by Christ, for his birth was the advent, the arrival of God to
          the earth in human form. Ukal means \u201CI am able\u201D or \u201CI am
          strong and mighty.\u201D When placed together, the meaning of these Hebrew
          names could read \u201CGather a harvest of sons who are blameless and obedient.
          They will have God with them, and they will be strong and mighty.\u201D

          The implication is that the perfections of this woman would exhaust the
          entire language. The subject is the perfect bride, the virtuous woman.
          This woman is both a picture of a virtuous wife and an incredible allegory
          of the end-time victorious bride of Jesus Christ, full of virtue and grace.

          The word    is most often used to describe valiant men. See  , where it
          is used for the mighty ones Moses was to commission as elders and leaders
          among the people. Because many of the cultural terms and metaphors used
          in this passage are not understood or even used in today\u2019s English-speaking
