          used to denote the end of a period of time, to    one season for the next
          one to come. This hints at the cutting off of temple worship, the kingdom

          in focus but the responsibility the king had given to him for the oversight
          of his affairs. Daniel and Joseph shared many parallels. Ashpenaz was to
          Daniel what Potiphar was to Joseph. Daniel could be considered the Bible\u2019s

          BC, which is the fifteenth day of the month of Tishri, the seventh month.
          According to the Jewish calendar, this was during the Feast of Tabernacles.
          According to Xenophon of Athens (ca. 430\u2013354 BC), who was a pupil
          of Socrates, Cyrus launched a nighttime attack that conquered the city
          of Babylon. He states that Cyrus told his troops: \u201CTonight we go against
          them when some are asleep and some are drunk, and all are unprepared\u201D
          (, 7.5.17\u201329). The Greek historian Herodotus, who wrote of the fall
          of Babylon about a hundred years after it happened, described the unusual
          way that Cyrus\u2019 army captured the city. Part of the army went north
          of Babylon and dug a trench from the Euphrates River to a nearby marsh.
          When the army connected the trench to the Euphrates River, much of the
          water in the river flowed toward the marsh while only a little water continued
          to flow toward Babylon. While the Babylonians were confidently celebrating
          at Belshazzar\u2019s feast, the strong river and moat protecting the city
          became extremely shallow, and the Medes and Persians were able to march
          right into the city without a battle. (See  ; Herodotus,  , 1.191;  , col.
          3.15.) Daniel was in his eighties when the events of this chapter took
          place. Perhaps Daniel knew from the prophecies of Isaiah that a deliverer
          was coming from the east by the name of Cyrus (see  ), whose destiny was
          to conquer Babylon and one day permit the return of the Jews to the land
          of Israel.    "

          The Persian goddess Anahita was pictured as riding on the back of a lion.
          The lions\u2019 den was a symbolic execution for anyone who placed another
          god above Anahita. If anyone blasphemed their goddess, they would have
          to face the wrath of the lions. For one to survive being thrown to the
          lions was a powerful spiritual sign to the king and the people of the land.
          Daniel\u2019s divine rescue was a significant lesson not lost on the king.
          He saw Daniel\u2019s God conquer their goddess Anahita. There were likely
          quite a number of lions kept in the den, for the politicians and their
          families could have numbered two or three hundred, and they all were devoured
          before they hit the ground (see v.  ). In a sense, Daniel took dominion
          over the lions with the power of God.      Or \u201CMay your God, whom
          you serve continually, come to your rescue.\u201D This may have been more
          than a fond wish, maybe even a direct statement of firm faith. How we pray
          that believers today would have such great faith as this pagan king. Compare
          the words of Nebuchadnezzar (see  ). The Aramaic word used for rescue is 
          , but    carries the implication that Daniel\u2019s rescue is because of
          love and affection. King Darius recognized that Daniel\u2019s God loved
          him so much that he would not let Daniel be killed by the lions. Additionally,
          the Aramaic has a Piel imperfect form that serves as a reflexive. The king
          may have been saying, in effect, \u201CThe God who loves you so much will
          deliver you to protect himself.\u201D    "

          This moment shows Daniel clearly as a type of the one who is greater than
          himself, Jesus Christ. Like Daniel, Jesus was blameless, a righteous man
          who was destined to rule. Daniel and Jesus were men of prayer. As with

          who turned away from their God and fell into idolatry, worshiping the Greek
          gods, during this time (see  ,  ). As a result, they were given over to

          holy one (angel) that Daniel heard speaking. There are two prominent views
          among scholars as to the identity and meaning of Palmoni, a hapax legomenon.
          Some view his name as a contraction of two Hebrew words:  , which means
          \u201Cwonderful\u201D or \u201Cmarvelous,\u201D and  , which means \u201Ca
          counted number.\u201D The angel Palmoni can be seen as the Wonderful Numberer
          or the Numberer of Secrets, who knew the exact numbers that would measure
          or count the time of the desolation of the temple and gives that number
          to Daniel. Since Jesus is described as the \u201CWonderful Counselor,\u201D
          perhaps Palmoni, the Wonderful Numberer, was Christ, making this a Christophany
          in Daniel\u2019s vision. Regardless, this verse shows us that numbers indeed
          have significance in Scripture and that their meanings and patterns were
          put there by God. We even have a book in the Bible called \u201CNumbers.\u201D
          An alternate view is that Palmoni or    is a contraction of a pronoun meaning
          \u201Ca certain one\u201D and  , a pronoun meaning \u201Cone who is not
          mentioned.\u201D These two pronouns are joined together to denote someone
          who is not named, i.e., with the sense of \u201Csuch and such a person.\u201D     
          The infinitive construct form    (from the verb  ) denotes a nominal form
          here, with the meanings \u201Cgiving over,\u201D \u201Chanding over,\u201D
          or \u201Csurrendering.\u201D      Or \u201Cthe host.\u201D Because the

          vile idol in the sanctuary, the latter interpretation is more likely. The

          spoke as he made an end of sin would have been the word  . This Scripture
          is one of the clearest prophetic signposts of the Messiah, Jesus, who would
          come and put an end to sin. The death of Jesus was the last of the sacrifices

          Messiah is confirmed by at least one church father from the early third
          century AD, Hippolytus of Rome, who wrote the earliest Christian commentary
          on Daniel. Gabriel states that six things will take place: (1) transgression
          will be finished, (2) sin will end, (3) guilt will be canceled, (4) everlasting
          righteousness (justice) will be established, (5) the prophetic vision will

          polluted garments of God\u2019s people, who wore tassels on the corners

          For example, a variety of corrections of the text have been proposed for
          the end of v.  . A literal rendering of the Hebrew text is something like

          best to read these three chapters (seventy-nine verses) in one sitting,

          Daniel experienced in understanding the meaning of the message.      Or

          six years old when he became king after the mysterious death of Ptolemy
          IV Philopator. (See Polybius,  , 15.25.3\u201318.) The Syrian king knew
          that Egypt was being ruled by a child and took his opportunity to launch
          his attack against the weakened Egyptian kingdom. The people of Judea were
          caught in between these battles between Ptolemaic rulers and the Seleucids
          (Syrians). The decisive battle between the kingdom of Egypt, led by the
          Egyptian general Scopas, and the forces of the kingdom of Syria was fought
          at Banas (later renamed Caesarea Philippi) in 200 BC. The Syrians ultimately
          defeated the Egyptians, which meant that Judea then came under Seleucid
          control. (See Edouard Will,    , vol. 2 [Paris: Seuil, 2003], 102.) It
          was then that the Jews made a pact with Antiochus III with the hope of

          Contextually, it would be Antiochus IV; however, what follows is difficult
          to fit into what is known of his life. Some commentators believe this king
          was Roman, possibly Herod the Great. (See Philip Mauro,    [Swengel, PA:

          himself above every god is possibly a reference to the title he bestowed
          upon himself: Epiphanes.    means \u201CGod manifest.\u201D    "
