          pleasant greeting to the Corinthians and begins this letter bursting with
          exuberant praise to God, who had delivered him from all of his painful
          ordeals. Tender mercy and compassion originate with God. As a kind father
          has compassion on his children, so God tenderly cares for each one of us.
          When suffering greets us, the God of mercy sustains us. His comfort is
          permanent and endless. See  .    "

          be translated \u201Con the outside battles and on the inside surrendering.\u201D
          With great honesty, Paul discloses his feelings while in Macedonia. He
          was beset with adversaries who opposed him, problems and arguments within
          the church, and persecution at every turn. Paul was emotionally torn by
          all the conflicts among the believers and feared for Titus\u2019 safety.
          He was worried about how the Corinthians would receive his severe letter,
          plus there is a hint in his words that his concern was wearing him down
          both physically and emotionally. Being honest about our emotions is the
          first step in finding comfort and peace. Paul\u2019s example of a leader
          opening his heart to his people should not be missed by this generation.    "

          \u201Cto turn from sin and come back to God\u201D; that is, \u201Cto have
          a change of mind/direction.\u201D This involves the \u201Csorrow\u201D
          or \u201Cremorse\u201D of our hearts before God. Repentance is not a sterile,
          feeling-less act of changing direction. Paul makes it clear that godly
          remorse is a \u201CGod-intended\u201D feeling that moves the heart back
          to God. Our repentance is not a work of the flesh but the result of God\u2019s
          Spirit stirring our conscience. Peter\u2019s godly remorse over his denial
          of Christ eventually led him to experience a complete inner healing, while
          Judas\u2019 remorse led him to suicide.  "

          This has caused some scholars to conclude that chs.    may have originally
          been separated from the earlier chapters, which could imply that the following
          four chapters make up the missing letter of Paul to the Corinthians. If
          this is so, when reading 2&nbsp;Corinthians, one could begin with chs.   
          (Paul\u2019s missing letter), then read from chs.  . The term for this
          is \u201Cappending\u201D; that is, taking an earlier document and adding

          \u201Cman\u201D Paul refers to in vv.    is himself: (1) He knew the exact
          time this ecstatic experience took place. (2) He knew that what was overheard
          in the third heaven was \u201Cinexpressible\u201D and not to be repeated.
          (3) He was not certain about what state he was in (embodied/disembodied).
          (4) In v.    he uses the first-person pronoun    (\u201Ca thorn in the
          flesh was given to me\u201D) as a counterbalance to the high level of revelation
          that Paul had received. It was a common literary device, a rhetorical ploy,
          to avoid speaking of oneself directly in this fashion and by using the
          phrase \u201CSomeone I\u2019m acquainted with\u201D (v.  ) when he, in
          fact, was referring to himself. It is a sign of Paul\u2019s humility and
          integrity that he did not \u201Cboast\u201D of this event that took place
          fourteen years earlier. Many today who have experiences with God are quick
          to tell what happened. Paul veiled his heavenly encounters with God and
          waited to share them only when it was appropriate and faith-building for
          others. Not every experience we have is meant to be shared immediately.

          Paul did not have a demon, though it was possible that a demon followed

          he endured, the constant misunderstanding and persecution that came to
