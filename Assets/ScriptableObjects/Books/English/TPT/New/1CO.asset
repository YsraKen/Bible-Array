          No doubt this statement was a tremendous shock to the Corinthians. To the
          Jews it would be earthshaking, for circumcision was the outward sign of
          God\u2019s covenant with Abraham and his descendants. Paul, as elsewhere,
          places the emphasis not on outer things but on an inward transformation
          that longs to please God.    "

          He had face-to-face encounters with Jesus (v.  ;  ). (3) The formation

          unselfish lifestyle resulted in not demanding to be paid for his ministry
          (vv.  ). (5) He was given a divine stewardship (vv.  ). (6) He was determined
          to win everyone through the gospel of Christ (vv.  ). (7) He lived a disciplined
          life in order to succeed in the obstacle course of ministry for Christ

        content: "  This literal translation is one of the most difficult verses
          in all the New Testament to translate and to interpret properly. Scholars
          and translators are divided in how to express this verse with proper meaning.
          First, Paul uses the Greek word    (authority), which is used for the authority
          of God, kings, and rulers, and can be translated \u201Cmight\u201D or \u201Cright.\u201D
          It never occurs as a metaphor speaking of a piece of apparel. This is not
          a symbol of authority, but true authority on \u201Cthe\u201D (not her)
          head under which she ministers. Before Pentecost, the woman was not seen
          as anyone with authority, but at Pentecost the Holy Spirit fell upon men
          and women, giving each person the authority to take the gospel with power
          to the ends of the earth and prophesy under the direction of the Holy Spirit.
          The Gospels both begin and end with a visitation of angels to women. The
          angel Gabriel came to Mary and the angels of God greeted the women at the
          empty tomb. However, the Aramaic word used here is a homonym that can mean
          both \u201Cpower\u201D and \u201Ccovering/veil.\u201D This may explain
          the variation of the Greek texts.    "

          (\u201Cthe clear display in light,\u201D or \u201Cpublic manifestations\u201D).     
          To summarize, God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit delights to give
          spiritual gifts to his people, the bride of Christ. These gifts are imparted
          by God to every believer upon conversion as the Holy Spirit chooses (v. 
          ). They will confirm the Word of God and expand the kingdom of God. Spiritual
          gifts can be neglected and misused, but they remain the divine power source
          for Christ\u2019s body on the earth. Through teaching, evangelizing, prophesying,
          and demonstrating the miraculous, God uses his people to expand his kingdom
          and to establish righteousness on the earth through the proper use of the
          gifts he has given. There is no place in Scripture or church history where
          these gifts were taken away or removed from the body of Christ. The church
          moves forward through these divine gifts. Spiritual gifts do not replace
          the Word of God, but the Word of God will spread and flourish as the fully
          equipped body of Christ operates in the wise use of God\u2019s enabling
          power.    "

          gift of the Holy Spirit to impart an understanding of strategy and insight
          that only God can give. This is more than simply wisdom, but the clearly
          crafted \u201Cword of wisdom\u201D to unlock the hearts of people and free
          the corporate body to move forward under God\u2019s direction. This gift
          will express the wisdom of the Holy Spirit, not of man. The best examples
          of this gift were (1) when Jesus saw Nathanael under the fig tree and knew
          his true character as a man without guile and (2) when Jesus spoke to the
          woman at the well and unlocked her heart with the words \u201CGo get your
          husband.\u201D See  .      The gift of the message (Gr.  ) of revelation
          knowledge has been defined by some as the Holy Spirit\u2019s impartation
          through an impression, a vision, or his voice that gives understanding
          of a person or situation that cannot be known through the natural mind
          of man. It may be exercised in the prayer for healing. This revelation
          knowledge is seen in Saul\u2019s healing of blindness in    and in    with
          Peter\u2019s revelation knowledge of Cornelius\u2019 servants outside his
          door and the subsequent salvation of Cornelius and his household. The word
          of revelation knowledge could also include knowing facts that are unknown
          to the speaker, such as names, dates, or events to come.    "

          virtue of all. Faith and hope are temporary, but love is eternal. Paul
          gives us ten characteristics of divine love in this chapter. Love (1) is
          patient under stress, (2) is kind at all times, (3) is generous, not envious,
          (4) is humble, not self-promoting, (5) is never rude, (6) does not manipulate
          by using shame, (7) is not irritable or easily offended, (8) celebrates
          honesty, (9) does not focus on what is flawed, and (10) is loyal to the
          end.      Unfortunately, there is a chapter break before this line. Chapter
          headings are not part of the inspired text. This translation has chosen
          to insert the partial text of    here in conclusion to Paul\u2019s masterful

        content: '  One interpretation of this passage is that Paul is quoting from
          a letter written by the Corinthians to him. They were the ones saying a
          woman should remain silent and Paul is responding to their questions. In
          other words, they were imposing a rule in the church that Paul refutes
          in v.  . Some manuscripts move vv.    to after v.  , which causes a few
          scholars to consider this as evidence of an early introduction into the
          text by Jewish scribes. The only two places in the New Testament where
          Paul writes about women being quiet or not teaching in the church are in
          his letters to the church of Ephesus (1&nbsp;Timothy) and Corinth. Both
          cities were centers of worship to the goddess Artemis (Diana), where women
          had the leading roles of teaching and temple prostitution was commonplace.

          death, and defeated sin, making us into victorious conquerors who have
          hope beyond the grave.    "
