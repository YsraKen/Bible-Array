          The apostles gazed upon Jesus both during Christ\u2019s earthly life and
          in resurrection glory.      The Aramaic text yields an interesting thought.
          By using the words    and    in the same context, we\u2019re taken back
          to the ancient prayer of the Hebrews known as the  : \u201CHear, O&nbsp;Israel,
          the Lord our God is one.\u201D John is stating that he has heard the One
          that Israel was commanded to listen to, and that One is Jesus Christ. See 
          .      The word for touch is poetic. It comes from a sensory verb meaning
          \u201Cto pluck the strings of an instrument.\u201D It can also be translated
          \u201Cto feel\u201D (see  ). It is as though John is saying, \u201CWe have
          plucked the chords of his being and felt what motivated him, his melody
          within.\u201D      Or \u201CWord [] of life.\u201D See the second footnote
          on  . This verse in both Greek and Aramaic breaks many rules of grammar
          and is used as a poetic tool to pack deep revelation in as few words as
          possible.    "

          to  , which means \u201Cto evangelize or preach the [life-giving] gospel.\u201D
          The Aramaic can be translated \u201CThis is the hope that we heard from
          him and gives you hope because God is light and there is absolutely no
          darkness in him.\u201D      Or \u201Cno darkness at all can find any place
          in him.\u201D Although we do not have these exact words in any of the four
          Gospels, it is clear that John and the apostles attributed these words
          to Jesus Christ. Not everything Jesus said or did is recorded in the Gospels.
          If all of the events given in Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John were condensed,

          God and the believer enjoy fellowship on the basis of walking in the light
          of God. Fellowship is maintained with God as we continue walking in the
          light he reveals to us. To walk in the light also involves being open,
          transparent, and honest, acknowledging any darkness the Lord might reveal
          in us. The blood of Jesus will cleanse us from all known sin, and if we
          continue to be open to God\u2019s pure light his blood will cleanse us
          from all unknown sin as well, enabling imperfect believers to walk in fellowship
          with a holy God. Freedom from sin (which is mentioned seventeen times in
          1&nbsp;John) is equated to walking in the pure light of God\u2014not simply
          a fleshly struggle but a desire to walk in fellowship with God in his light.    "

      comments:
      - number: 1:9
        content: "  Confession of sin is the way to find restoration and unbroken
          fellowship with God. It cleanses the conscience and removes every obstacle
          from communion with Christ. Confession does not gain God\u2019s acceptance,
          for that was won for us forever by the sacrifice of Christ. It is on the
          basis of being his dearly loved children that we restore intimacy with
          God through our tenderhearted confession before him. God will always be
          faithful to restore our first-love passion for him. There is no need to
          confess the same sins over and over, for that is ignoring the blood of
          Jesus that cleanses us. All of our sins were paid for on the cross and
          we can do nothing to remove them, but confession acknowledges God\u2019s
          faithfulness to restore our intimacy with him. Our Father and our forgiving
          Redeemer fill the heavens with grace toward every believer, even when we
          sin.      \u201CUnrighteousness,\u201D in this context, means the sins
          we\u2019re not aware of. Confession cleanses known sin and restores fellowship
          with God, but God\u2019s faithfulness, in seeing Christ as our Sin-Bearer,
          cleanses us from all unknown sin as well. If we do but one thing (confess
          our sin), God will do four things: (1) demonstrate his faithful love, (2)
          demonstrate justice by counting our sins paid for by Christ, (3) forgive
          us every sin, and (4) continue a deeper work of cleansing from all aspects
          of sin\u2019s defilement.    "

          confess our failure to him and move forward in faith. This is like a \u201Crebound\u201D

          is no one individual named \u201Cthe antichrist\u201D (or enemy of Christ)
          in the Bible. (The definite article    is never used in connection to antichrist
          [or \u201Canti-anointing\u201D].) John tells us that the \u201Cspirit of
          antichrist\u201D has already been in the world () and that many antichrists
          (false teachers who oppose the truth of Christ and have a following) have
          already come. John\u2019s warning is that we must set our hearts firmly
          on the truths of Jesus Christ and his Word as protection from the multiple
          lies that will increasingly try to deceive believers. The words    and   
          are not found in the book of Revelation but only in 1 and 2&nbsp;John.    "

          in him we receive the gift of salvation. (5) How can I really know that

          and then demonstrate it by loving others, we have the assurance of our
          salvation. (6) How can I know that God loves me? His love prompted him
