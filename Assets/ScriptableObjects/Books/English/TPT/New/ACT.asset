        content: "  Some scholars believe that Theophilus could be a symbolic name
          and not necessarily one individual. This is most likely not written to
          one individual. When the meaning of his name is translated, the sentence
          reads, \u201CI wrote to you before, O&nbsp;lover of God.\u201D Both Luke
          and Acts were written to every lover of God.      This account was written
          by Luke, the human author of the Gospel of Luke. The title Lord Jesus is
          found only in the Aramaic. The Greek is simply \u201CJesus.\u201D     
          Although Jesus\u2019 work of redemption has been completed for us, there
          is still the unfinished work of preparing and beautifying his eternal partner,
          the bride of Christ. With gifts of power Jesus\u2019 church is continuing
          what he began to do and teach through evangelism and discipleship. See

          them the mysteries of God\u2019s kingdom realm. See also  .      The number
          forty is significant, for it speaks of transformation and completeness
          through testing. Jesus was tempted for forty days, the deluge during Noah\u2019s
          day lasted forty days and nights, Moses met with God for forty days on
          Sinai, Israel wandered for forty years, and Elijah fasted for forty days.
          Jesus spent forty days appearing to his disciples to teach them that a
          day of completeness and transformation had arrived. It took them forty
          days to comprehend that Christ\u2019s kingdom was spiritual, not political.

          will say everything that is on his mind with no restraint, flowing out
          of his heart with confidence. It involves being frank and honest, hiding
          nothing and speaking directly to the heart. Most often it is a word used
          for public speaking. It refers to speech that is not tailored to make everyone
          happy but to speak the truth, in spite of what that may cost. It is the
          courage to speak truth into the ears of others. This was reserved for only
          the highest rank of Greek citizens, not people of other lands or slaves.
          The right to speak freely was an essential aspect of Athenian democracy.
          Although it is sometimes associated with negative speech, in this context   
          refers to an unrestrained boldness. There was a Greek idiom that said essentially,
          \u201CIf you tell me the truth no matter what that truth turns out to be,
          I will not punish you.\u201D This was known as the Parresiastic Contract.

          The Aramaic is \u201CHe was loved by God.\u201D Ancient Hebrew scholars
          believed Moses may have had a shining of glory on his countenance when
          he was born, distinguishing him as a special servant of the Lord God. This
          shining face would later mark him as one who dwelt in the presence of the
          Lord (). Moses was a type or picture of the Lord Jesus Christ. No one was
          fairer than he; but no one was more extraordinary than our Lord. We learn
          from    that Moses\u2019 father was Amram and his mother was Jochebed.
          Amram means \u201Cfamily of the lofty One\u201D and Jochebed means \u201CYah
          makes great.\u201D The sister of Moses was Miriam (the Hebrew name for
          Mary), which comes from the root word for \u201Cmyrrh,\u201D meaning \u201Caromatic,\u201D

          today as Midhat Pasha Souq. Damascus, only 190 miles northeast of Jerusalem,
          in 2017 has a population of about two million and is considered to be the
          oldest continually inhabited city in the world. Many remnants of the Roman
          occupation, including two-thirds of the walls of the city, can still be
          seen today. The conversion of Saul the legalist into Paul the grace preacher
          has a significant lesson for us. We can be amazingly wrong while thinking
          we are doing right. The Holy Spirit awakens our hearts to feast on Christ,
          our righteousness. Religion has a deadening effect on our hearts. Like
          Saul, we have to fall off our \u201Chigh horse\u201D and bite the dust
          before our blinded eyes can see.      Tarsus, or Cilicia, is in southeastern

          He truly was the Lord\u2019s gracious gift to Paul, who was healed by God\u2019s
          gracious gift. The word    is found 125 times in the New Testament, and
          Paul uses the word 120 times.      Ananias means \u201CYah is merciful.\u201D
          This is a wonderful play on words in the Aramaic, for God is about to show
          mercy to Saul and is asking Ananias to live up to his name.    "

          Greek is \u201CStraight Street.\u201D As the straightest street in the
          city, this is the main east-west thoroughfare in Damascus, which is known
          today as Midhat Pasha Souq. Damascus, only 190 miles northeast of Jerusalem,
          in 2017 has a population of about two million and is considered to be the
          oldest continually inhabited city in the world. Many remnants of the Roman
          occupation, including two-thirds of the walls of the city, can still be
          seen today. The conversion of Saul the legalist into Paul the grace preacher
          has a significant lesson for us. We can be amazingly wrong while thinking
          we are doing right. The Holy Spirit awakens our hearts to feast on Christ,
          our righteousness. Religion has a deadening effect on our hearts. Like
          Saul, we have to fall off our \u201Chigh horse\u201D and bite the dust
          before our blinded eyes can see.      Tarsus, or Cilicia, is in southeastern
          Turkey. Tarsus means \u201Ca basket.\u201D See v.  .      Or \u201CJudas\u2019
          house.\u201D (Judah\u2019s house is the house of praise).      Made explicit
          from the text.      Ananias means \u201Cthe Lord\u2019s gracious gift.\u201D
          He truly was the Lord\u2019s gracious gift to Paul, who was healed by God\u2019s
          gracious gift. The word    is found 125 times in the New Testament, and
          Paul uses the word 120 times.      Ananias means \u201CYah is merciful.\u201D
          This is a wonderful play on words in the Aramaic, for God is about to show
          mercy to Saul and is asking Ananias to live up to his name.    "

          known for its beauty and recognized as the capital of the Syrian kingdom.
          The church prospered greatly in Antioch, and it became a Christian hub

          Antioch remained a strong witness for evangelization, sending missionaries

          the church, every believer was a missionary. There was a great cost involved
          with following Christ. They laid their lives down to serve him and to make

        content: '  Tradition says that Paul was eventually released from house arrest
          and traveled to Spain. But the inspired account ends here, with Paul ministering
          to all who came to him. This completes the Acts of the Holy Spirit as recorded
          by Luke. Although the book of Acts is finished, the acts of God continue
          to be accomplished through his apostolic company of surrendered lovers.
          Every believer has the same Holy Spirit and can do the works of Jesus on
          the earth today.  '
