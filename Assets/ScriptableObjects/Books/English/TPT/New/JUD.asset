          a master; love is implied.      This Jacob was the brother of our Lord

          as a sign of his humility. Instead of introducing himself as the half brother
          of Jesus, he chose to describe himself simply as a \u201Cloving servant

          realm to come to earth to have intercourse with women in order to corrupt
          the godly lineage of Seth. Cain had already gone into the darkness of sin,
          but the godly line of Seth would one day bring forth Noah, and from his
          seed (Shem) Jesus would eventually be born. The rebellious rank of angels
          mentioned here had sex with women who then gave birth to the Nephilim (mighty
          giants). Ancient references to this can be found in the writings of early
          Jewish writers, including Josephus and Philo of Alexandria, as well as
          early church fathers, such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Clement of Alexandria,
          Ambrose of Milan, Athenagoras, Tertullian, Eusebius, Lactantius, Jerome,
          Augustine of Hippo, and Sulpicius Severus. All of them, along with the
          Septuagint, identified these sons of God as the offspring of angels. See

          after the women of Sodom who had offspring (Nephilim) from their sexual
          relations with them. Both humanity and angels violated the boundaries God
          had set in place.      Judah gives us three examples from ancient history
          in vv.  , pointing to those who experienced wonderful privileges from God
          but terribly abused God\u2019s grace and so were punished. Sodom and Gomorrah
          was described as fertile, fruitful, \u201Clike the garden of the Lord\u201D
          (). Each example cited (Israel\u2019s exodus, angels that sinned, and the
          cities of sexual perversion) serves as an example and a warning that God
          judges sin. There is an eternal punishment of fire awaiting all who refuse
          to hide themselves in the love and grace of God, which is expressed through
          Christ toward us.    "
