        content: "  Or \u201Cpresbyter.\u201D This was obviously a self-designated
          term for the apostle John. He was an elder because of being the only living
          apostle who was chosen by Jesus.      Gaius was a convert of John\u2019s
          and a close friend who likely had a leadership position in the church (location
          not given). Church tradition states that he was one of the seventy whom
          Jesus sent out and was later ordained by John as the bishop of Pergamum.
          See    (7.46.9; Funk 1, 454). However, there was also a Gaius who became
          the bishop of Ephesus. There are four mentions of Gaius in the New Testament,
          although it is unlikely that they were the same person (;  ;  ). The name
          Gaius means \u201Cjoyful or happy.\u201D The Latin form of    can be translated
          \u201Clord.\u201D      Or \u201Ccontinually love in truth\u201D (reality).    "

        and that you continually enjoy good health, just as your soul is prospering. '
      comments:
      - number: 2
        content: "  The Greek word    means \u201Cto be brought along to a smooth
          and prosperous journey\u201D or \u201Cto be continually prospered [unto
          success] in every way.\u201D The Aramaic can be translated \u201Cas much
          as succeeds you.\u201D See  .      John is praying that Gaius\u2019 physical
          health would match his spiritual health. God is concerned for both our
          physical health (he gave our bodies an immune system) and our souls (emotional
          and spiritual well-being). If physical health and soul \u201Cprosperity\u201D
          were not the will of God, why would John pray that for Gaius?    "

        content: '  These are traveling missionaries and itinerant speakers who were
          shown hospitality by Gaius. True hospitality is a lost art in some churches
          today and needs to be valued anew.    '

        the beautiful acts of love you have shown them.  Now, if you would be so
        kind, send them on their way with a generous gift, in a manner that would
        honor God.   '

        content: "  This would likely have been the church where John was ministering
          (Ephesus, Pergamum, or another unnamed location).      As translated from
          the Aramaic.      Or \u201Cequal to God\u2019s value of them.\u201D Apparently,
          these missionaries had reported to John, returned to the area where Gaius
          was living, and then continued on with their missionary journey. The Aramaic
          is quite different: \u201CYou outfitted them like a plank billboard for
          God\u201D; that is, \u201CThe gifts you gave them made them an advertisement
          for God.\u201D    "

      title: 
      number: 9
      content: 'I have already written you once about this, [[COMMENT(0)]] but Diotrephes, 
        who loves to be in charge and recognized as first among you, does not acknowledge
        our authority. '
      comments:
      - number: 9
        content: "  This refers to a lost letter, possibly destroyed by Diotrephes.
          So the letter we now have is actually 4&nbsp;John.      Diotrephes was
          most likely an elder in the congregation who saw himself as the most important
          one, pushing himself forward with a controlling leadership style. He refused
          the apostolic authority of John and would not accept guest speakers who
          may have been sent by John. His name means \u201Cnourished by Jupiter.\u201D
          Leaders must view other leaders not as threats but as coworkers. Love is
          not controlling or tyrannical. It is clear in the New Testament that the
          local church must have God-appointed ministry in the congregation from
          pastors, prophets, teachers, evangelists, and apostles (). Additionally,
          there were itinerant ministers that\u2014if proven authentic\u2014were
          to be received by the local church authorities and given both opportunities
          to minister and generous gifts to send them on their way.    "

      content: "So if I come, I will address what he\u2019s doing\u2014spreading
        his malicious slander against us. [[COMMENT(0)]] And not content with that,
        he refuses to welcome our brothers,  and he stands in the way of those who
        want to receive them and show them hospitality by throwing them out of the
        church!"

      title: Devoted Demetrius
      number: 11
      content: "Delightfully loved ones, don\u2019t imitate what is evil, but imitate
        that which is good. [[COMMENT(0)]] Whoever does good is of God; whoever does
        evil has not seen God. "
      comments:
      - number: 11
        content: "  The Aramaic gives an entirely different slant to this verse.
          It can be translated \u201CBeloved, don\u2019t treat him with malice but
          with blessing\u201D (good deeds).      This last clause is asyndetic in
          order to add emphasis.    "

      number: 12
      content: As for Demetrius, everyone speaks very highly of him, [[COMMENT(0)]]
        and even the truth itself stands by his side. We too wholeheartedly endorse
        him, and you know that our recommendation is reliable.
      comments:

        content: "  It is possible that Demetrius was one of the \u201Cbrothers\u201D
          (v.  ) who was now coming to visit the church and that he was the one who
          carried this letter to Gaius. This letter served the purpose of being a
          \u201Cletter of recommendation\u201D of Demetrius and his ministry.    "
