          Literally \u201Cquietly.\u201D In the context of that day, it referred
          to women arguing with their male congregational leaders. In the temple
          worship of Diana, the goddess of the Ephesian people, it was most common
          to have female leadership. For the women who converted to Christ, their
          only cultural context of worship was that the women were the leaders. In
          the church, however, it was the men who more commonly made up the leadership
          of the congregations. Paul telling the women to \u201Cbe willing to learn\u201D
          means he was instructing them to take a respectful posture of a disciple
          in this new way of worshiping the true God. When Paul instructs them not
          to be teachers, he was apparently referring to their old religious system
          where it was the women who were the temple leaders and teachers of their
          goddess religion in Ephesus. This entire passage from    is arguably one
          of the more difficult texts to translate in Paul\u2019s writings, and has
          a number of plausible translations and interpretations. However, this translation
          has chosen to make clear what was implicitly understood by the early Christians
          in Ephesus, making it explicit for those of us from another culture and
          another era.    "

        content: "  This is the only place where this phrase occurs in the New Testament.
          The \u201Cmystery of righteousness\u201D (godliness) is Jesus Christ living
          within the believer. The word    (secret) is found twenty-seven times in
          the New Testament. We \u201Cmust faithfully embrace the mysteries of our
          faith while keeping a clean conscience\u201D (v.  ). Although Paul did
          speak Greek, his native language was Aramaic, which is difficult to translate
          into Greek. The Aramaic word used here for mysteries is  . This is the
          Aramaic word for a cedar tree. A cedar tree has deep, firm roots. So must
          our faith be rooted inside these mysteries.      As translated by the implication
          of the Aramaic. The Greek says, \u201Cjustified in the Spirit.\u201D Although
          some interpret it to mean his resurrection, that seems indefinite and with
          little meaning to today\u2019s reader. There is deep and beautiful poetic
          artistry here in this passage. The word order of the Aramaic lines is convincing
          that glorious and hidden truths are tucked into these verses; they are
          full of Jewish word plays and symbolism and read like a poem. Many have
          concluded that this passage was an ancient hymn sung by the early church.
          Two different Aramaic words for \u201Crighteousness\u201D are used in v. 
          . The first word is    which is clearly connected to the word for \u201Cpriest\u201D
          or  . An Aramaic or Hebrew reader would clearly connect this \u201Crighteousness\u201D
          to the priestly ministry. In poetic and perhaps subtle linguistic form,
          this points us to the High Priest of our faith. The second word used that
          is most often translated \u201Crighteousness\u201D is  ; the word in the
          line before used for messenger (angels) is  , which is a form of the word
          for king (). To summarize, you have the words \u201Cgreat [high] priest,\u201D
          \u201Cking,\u201D and \u201Crighteousness,\u201D which is the name for
          Melchizedek, (King of Righteousness). Truly, this mystery of righteousness
          is great!  "
