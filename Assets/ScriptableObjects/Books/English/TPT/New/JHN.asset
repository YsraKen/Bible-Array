        content: "  Most scholars consider the first eighteen verses of John to be
          the words of an ancient hymn or poem that was cherished by first-century
          believers in Christ.      The Greek is  , which has a rich and varied background
          in both Greek philosophy and Judaism. The Greeks equated    with the highest
          principle of cosmic order. God\u2019s    in the Old Testament conveys his
          powerful self-expression in creation, revelation, and redemption. In the
          New Testament we have this new unique view of God given to us by John,
          which signifies the presence of God himself in the flesh. Some have translated
          this rich term as \u201CWord.\u201D Though the Greek term    may be rendered
          \u201Cword,\u201D it would be wrong to think it indicates primarily a lexical
          unit in a sentence.    is more accurately understood as a form of self-revealing
          or \u201Cmessage.\u201D Jesus Christ is the eternal Message, the creative
          Word, and the Living Expression of God made visible. He is the divine self-expression
          of all that God is, contains, and reveals in incarnated flesh. Just as
          we express ourselves in words, God has perfectly expressed himself in Christ.
          Jesus is God\u2019s Story.      The Living Expression (Christ) fully possesses
          every attribute of deity held by God the Father (). The Living Expression
          existed eternally as a separate individual but essentially the same, as
          one with the Father.    "

        content: "  The Greek word used here and the Hebraic concept conveyed is
          that of being before God\u2019s face. There is no Hebrew word for \u201Cpresence\u201D
          (i.e., the \u201Cpresence\u201D of God), only the word \u201Cface.\u201D

          but John speaks of eternity past, a beginning before time existed. The
          Living Expression is Christ who existed eternally as part of the Trinity.
          He has no beginning, being one with the Father.    "

          the Samaritan woman to be Photini. An internet search of her name will
          yield many interesting stories about her post-conversion ministry, including
          her being named as an \u201Capostle\u201D of Jesus and her eventual martyrdom.
          Regardless of the validity of the extrabiblical references, history records
          her as the first New Testament evangelist to win a city to Christ. God
          is faithful to use anyone to reach others when we are honest to tell others
          that Jesus knows everything we\u2019ve ever done and still loves us.    "

          the woman had the revelation of who Jesus really was, for she addressed
          Jesus with the divine name in the Aramaic,  , Lord    . The Greek texts
          use the word    for \u201CLord,\u201D which can also mean \u201Csir\u201D
          or \u201Clandowner.\u201D      The Greek has the emphatic use of the personal
          pronoun.      The Aramaic is \u201CNeither do I put you down\u201D (or
          \u201Coppress you\u201D). The Torah required two witnesses. There were
          none left!      Or \u201Cno longer be sinning.\u201D It should be noted
          that this entire episode (referred to commonly as the \u201CPericope Adulterae\u201D)
          is missing in the majority of the most reliable Greek manuscripts. There
          are some manuscripts that have this story at the end of the book of John
          and at least two that include it in the Gospel of Luke. Many scholars surmise
          that this episode in the ministry of Jesus was added after the Gospel of
          John had been completed. However, it is the conclusion of this translation
          that the above text is indeed an inspired account of the ministry of Jesus
          and may have been deleted by many translators and copyists who doubted
          that Jesus could tell an adulterer that he would not condemn her. Augustine,
          one of the early church fathers, mentioned this story and stated that many
          translators had removed it because they interpreted it as Jesus giving
          license to immorality. God\u2019s grace always seems to startle the religious

          The three major groups in Israel at that time were Judeans (Jews), Galileans,

          was a Galilean, having come from Nazareth. But Nazareth was part of the
          northern region looked down upon by the Jews. The Aramaic can be translated

        content: "  The Aramaic can be translated \u201CI desired [loved] them.\u201D
          The Greek is \u201CI pray for them.\u201D This translation has chosen to
          include both concepts.      This is emphatic in the Greek sentence structure.
          How could it be that Jesus loved the world and gave himself for the sin
          of the world, yet emphasized that he was praying for his disciples and
          not praying for the world? Jesus\u2019 coming into the world brought life
          to those who believe and judgment to those who do not. The implication
          is that the key to reaching the world is the life, maturity, unity, and
          love of the disciples. This does not mean that Jesus didn\u2019t love the
          world, but that the world will only be reached when the disciples come
          into the fullness of Christ and in unity of the faith. This is what consumed
          the heart of Jesus as he prayed for them before the cross.    "

          and in anger. We hinder people\u2019s ability to hear our message (we cut
          off their ear) when we walk in angry offense toward others.      Malchus\u2019
          name means \u201Cking.\u201D Perhaps at the moment of healing his ear,
          Jesus personally revealed himself to Malchus in a supernatural way, the
          King who healed a king. Jesus is the true servant to the High Priest. We
          can imagine Jesus reaching out his hand to help Malchus up. And in an instant,
          Malchus believes. Malchus\u2019 ears, both of them, are healed.    "

          authorities were reminding Pilate that it would ruin his career if he pardoned
          Jesus. The term \u201Cfriend of Caesar\u201D was an honorific title given
          only to the ruling wealthy class of Romans who would have access to the
          emperor\u2019s court. Many of these friends of Caesar were senators and
          members of the Equestrian Order, known also as the Knights. Pilate\u2019s
          position was a political appointment due to his being a member of this
          elite class of Romans who took an oath of loyalty to Caesar. They were,
          in effect, threatening to inform Rome that Pilate was allowing treason
          in Caesar\u2019s empire. As one historian remarked, \u201COne false move
          and his appointment would be cancelled and his career finished\u201D (P.
          Barnett,  , Illinois: InterVarsity, 1999, p. 147). This overruled Pilate\u2019s
          desire to set Jesus free. He went on to condemn him to death. To place

          , and is taken from a root word that means \u201Cto set on fire.\u201D
          This was the word Jesus would have used to ask Peter, \u201CDo you burn
          with love for me?\u201D Our love for Jesus must be passionate and kindle
          a holy flame within our hearts. See  .      As often is the case, Jesus\u2019
          words have more than one meaning. \u201CThese\u201D can refer to the fish
          they had just caught, for Peter was a fisherman and loved to fish. He may
          have been counting and sorting the fish when Jesus asked him that question.
          But \u201Cthese\u201D most likely refers to the other disciples. It was
          Peter\u2019s boast that he loved Jesus more than the others, and though
          everyone else would leave him, Peter never would. That boast proved empty,
          as within hours of making the claim, Peter denied he even knew Jesus three
          times. So Jesus asked Peter three times if he loved him. In essence, Jesus
          knew how to bring healing to Peter and remove the pain of his denial. Three
          times Peter denied Jesus, but three times he made his confession of his
          deep love for Christ. By the third time, the \u201Ccrowing rooster\u201D
          inside Peter had been silenced, and now he was ready to be a shepherd for
          Jesus\u2019 flock.      The Aramaic is \u201Cfeed my rams\u201D (male lambs).
          This may refer to the other disciples. In v.    the Aramaic is simply \u201Csheep.\u201D
          And in v.    in Aramaic, Jesus used the third term \u201Cewes\u201D (female
          lambs). Some see in these that Peter was symbolically given charge of three
          flocks: Jews, Samaritans, and gentiles. Regardless, men and women need
          to be cared for and fed by the leadership of Christ\u2019s church among
          the nations.    "
