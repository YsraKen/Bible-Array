          the New Testament. It combines    (to lift) with    (veil, hide, cover),
          and so could be translated \u201Cthe lifting of the veil\u201D or \u201Cthe
          unveiling.\u201D The implication could be stated as simply, \u201CHere
          he is!\u201D It is not primarily lifting the veil off coming events, but
          the unveiling of Jesus.      This is the Greek word  , which means \u201Cbond
          servant,\u201D a slave who willingly remains with his master even after
          being given his freedom.      This does not necessarily mean \u201Csoon\u201D
          from the writer\u2019s perspective, but that once the time comes it will
          quickly happen. The Greek phrase    (similar to \u201Ctachometer\u201D)
          means that once something starts, it will take place swiftly.      Or \u201Cto
          make known (by a miracle-sign).\u201D The Greek uses the verb  , which
          means \u201Cto give a sign.\u201D The noun form is    and is the word used
          most often (seventy-seven times) in the New Testament for \u201Cmiracle.\u201D
          In the Septuagint of    the word    is used, which indicates the meaning
          of \u201Cto symbolize.\u201D The Aramaic likewise can be translated \u201Csymbolized.\u201D
          The book of Revelation is a book full of symbols.      Angels were instrumental
          in imparting divine revelation to Abraham, Moses, Joshua, the judges, the
          prophets, the kings, and the apostles of Jesus. This angel sent from Jesus
          was on a mission to give John insights into the meaning of the visions
          within the book of Revelation (,  ,  ).      Notice the chain of communication:
          (1) God gave the revelation directly to Jesus. (2) Jesus gave it to an
          angel. (3) The angel explained it to John. (4) John gives it to us (v. 
          ), God\u2019s servants. Many don\u2019t realize that the book of Revelation
          came from a direct encounter with an angel sent by Jesus to give the contents
          to John.    "

          See Beasley-Murray,  , 69; Robert L. Thomas,    and    (Chicago: Moody
          Press, 1992), 1995; R. C. H. Lenski,  , 1963.      The messages to the
          seven churches from Jesus Christ found in chs.    have at least four applications:
          (1) a local application to the specific cities and believers in the church;
          (2) to all the churches of all generations; (3) a prophetic application
          unveiling seven distinct phases of church history from the days of the
          apostle John until today; (4) a personal application to individual believers
          who have ears to hear what the Spirit is saying.  "

          meat that was sacrificed to idols. There was manna hidden within the ark
          of the covenant, and there is now hidden manna within the heart of the
          overcomer. See also  ,  ,  .      The Greek word    can be translated either
          \u201Cshining\u201D or \u201Cbright [white].\u201D It is possible that
          this stone shines brightly from within (i.e., a glowing stone). See G.
          H. R. Horsley and S. R. Llewelyn,    I\u2013VI (North Ryde: Ancient History
          Documentary Research Centre, 1981\u201392). This would remind us of the
          stones on the ephod-breastplate of the high priest () or the Urim and Thummim
          that glowed as God responded to the questions of his people. Jewish tradition
          has held that precious stones also fell from heaven with the manna (cf.
          Midrash  ). Some scholars see this white shining stone as a reference to
          a vote of acquittal in a court case (). Others as the burning white coal
          from off the altar that purged Isaiah\u2019s lips (). Whatever this \u201Cshining
          white stone\u201D is, it is to be prized as the victor\u2019s reward. Every
          believer is a \u201Cliving stone\u201D ().      We see that there are personal
          mysteries imparted to God\u2019s people; that is, secrets that are between
          the believer and Jesus. Only someone devoted to God is to know the meaning
          of the shining white stone and the name written upon it. In the first century
          AD, the white stone became an engagement stone. It later took on the form
          of an engagement ring with the white stone being represented as a diamond.
          A bridegroom would give his bride a white stone with a special name engraved
          upon it, a pet name of endearment as lovers for life. Such names could
          be embarrassing and thus were kept secret and used only between themselves.
          Only one person in the world could call a woman by that special name, and
          that would be her husband, her beloved.    "

          Jesus and his Father, in the same way, are knocking on the doors of our

          It is likely that the word used here is not identical to our modern jasper,
          but instead refers to a clear stone like crystal (cryptocrystalline jasper).   
          describes it as being clear like crystal. The most common Hebrew word for
          jasper is  , as found in    and  , which describes the last or twelfth
          jewel on the breastplate of Aaron, the high priest. The word    literally
          means \u201Cpolished.\u201D Jasper is recognized as a symbol of the glory
          of God in all his splendor, brightness, and beauty.      \u201CCarnelian\u201D
          (also known as \u201Csard\u201D) is a mineral red in color and commonly
          described as a glassy, translucent, semiprecious gemstone. The etymological
          origin of    comes from the Latin word  , used for the cornel cherry. Assuming
          it to be cherry-red (blood red) in color, translucent light was glowing
          from the one seated on the throne. The sardius (carnelian) stone was placed
          first in order upon the high priest\u2019s breastplate.      Or \u201Chalo.\u201D     
          See  . This was not a typical rainbow, for a rainbow has seven colors.
          This was more like a halo of light, shining all around the throne. It was
          a full circle, not a half-circle. It could have been horizontally or vertically
          around the throne. The Greek also allows for the translation \u201Ca rainbow
          made of emerald.\u201D The emerald rainbow points to God\u2019s mercy and
          covenant love, for he gave the sign of a rainbow to Noah, signifying that
          he would never again destroy the world through a flood. The rainbow around
          the throne would be a clear symbol that everything God does (coming from
          his throne of majesty) is surrounded with grace and mercy. The Hebrew word
          for \u201Cemerald\u201D is  , which can also be translated \u201Cflashing
          of light\u201D (). God\u2019s glory is represented by these three stones:

          not pestilence, but death. To kill with death is not trying to die to flesh,

          death too (). We cannot kill ourselves or by self-effort bring our flesh

          be removed to make room for a new heaven. When Jesus was baptized, the
          new heavens were opened up to him like a scroll, inaugurating this era
          of an open heaven through Christ.      Upon opening the sixth seal, the
          scene changes to earth. The power of God is released, which shakes every
          continent and every island. Yet is this destruction meant to be taken literally?
          Great earthquakes throughout the Bible were a regular feature of divine
          visitation. Methods, movements, governments, and structures (mountains
          and islands) will all be shaken by God in this wonderful visitation. Stars
          do not literally fall to the earth. Some of them are so huge they are larger
          than our solar system. If they were to fall, it would destroy all that
          we know. Yet, as we read further into the book of Revelation, we find that
          the earth continues to exist. So this scene must be taken symbolically.
          The old order of the natural realm is passing away and a new order is being
          established. There are many prophecies of the Old Testament referring to
          the lights going out on the old order as something new is set in place
          (;  ;  ;  ;  ). A superior light of the kingdom of God will make dim the

          Antichrist in the book of Revelation. The beast is equated to the nature

          the devil, but human nature. The number six is always equated with man,
          for man was created on the sixth day. The wild beast rising out of the
          ground (which man was made from) is the sin of man that wars against our
          souls and prevents the image of Christ from emerging in fullness within
          believers. The number 666 cannot be literal, for a literal number would
          need no wisdom to interpret. Both the mark of the beast and the mark on
          the foreheads of God\u2019s faithful followers is a metaphor of the character
          of the beast revealed by thoughts (foreheads) and by actions (the hands).
          By associating \u201Cthe wild beast\u201D with 666, John is pointing us

          Some calculate it to be about 600 feet, which would make it over 180 miles.
          But in the Aramaic, a stadia (race track) is measured at about 1/8 of a
          mile, which would make nearly 140 miles. It is impossible to view this
          as literal, for that much blood of human beings would be over ten thousand
          times the population of earth. The number forty is the number of testing/trial
