      comments:

        content: "  John was not afraid to violate religious taboos. A camel was
          considered unclean in the Jewish tradition. He was wearing what others
          considered to be unclean. Those who break loose of religious tradition
          will often appear to be undignified, as was John. His commission was to
          inaugurate a new way of living according to the truths of Jesus Christ
          and the Holy Spirit.      This was considered to be the wardrobe of a prophet
          and was identical to what the prophet Elijah wore (;  ). With a diet of
          locusts John points back to the four varieties of locusts mentioned in 
          . Locusts (grasshoppers) are an emblem of intimidation that will keep believers
          from taking their inheritance by faith. Israel thought themselves to be
          like grasshoppers in their own eyes because of the intimidation of the
          fierce inhabitants of the land. John the Baptizer arrives on the scene
          and makes locusts his food, eating up that symbol of intimidation (devouring
          the devourer). And he drank honey, which is a biblical metaphor of the
          revelation of God\u2019s Word that is sweeter than honey (). John\u2019s
          ministry was a prophetic statement from God that a new day had come, a
          day of leaving dead formalism and embracing new life in Jesus without intimidation.    "

          the twelve-year-old girl. It would be hard to keep hidden from the people.
          Jesus was cautioning them because of the reaction of certain religious
          authorities who were convinced that Jesus was working wonders by the power
          of Satan. Later on, the miracle of Lazarus being raised from the dead was
          what triggered the arrest of Jesus.  '

          That is, they didn\u2019t understand the lesson that the miracle was meant
          to teach them\u2014that God has the power to deliver us, no matter what
          the limitation. Also, the miracle was that the bread multiplied in their
          hands, so they likewise had the power to rebuke the stormy wind and sail
          through to the other side, even if Jesus were to pass them. He wanted them
          to see things in a new light and know the authority that they now carried.
          The two lessons of the multiplied loaves were the following: (1) that Jesus
          had all power to meet every need, and (2) that the disciples carried this
          power with them, for the bread multiplied in their hands. They were also
          a part of the miracle. See also  . The two great miracles of Israel were

          in the New Testament, to describe the utter astonishment of the people
          over this miracle. Jesus led the man away from the unbelief of others to
          work his miracle and healed him with his saliva. (Later, wicked men would
          spit upon him in public.) Jesus then told the man he healed not to tell
          others, but he did. Jesus tells us to spread the good news, and we don\u2019t.

          the feeding of the five thousand, but only Matthew and Mark give us the
          feeding of the four thousand. Many have called this the forgotten miracle.
          Jesus multiplied food twice with miracle power. Because of the locations
          of these two miracles, it is believed that the five thousand were mostly
          Jews and the four thousand mentioned here were mostly gentiles. First the
          Jew, then the gentile. First there were twelve baskets of leftovers, then
          seven large baskets full. Twelve is a distinctively Jewish number representing
          government, and seven represents fullness, indicating the fullness of blessing
          going out to the entire world. The Bread of Life, Jesus Christ, is now

          sun; yet on Mount Calvary, his face was beaten to a pulp. On this mountain,
          his clothing was glistening white; yet on Mount Calvary, his clothing was
          taken from him and he was bleeding crimson. On this mountain, he had at
          his side two of the greatest men ever to live, Moses and Elijah; yet on
          Mount Calvary, he had at his side two murderers. On this mountain, the
          glory of God overshadowed him; yet on Mount Calvary, he was alone, forsaken,
          in the dark. On this mountain, we hear the Father\u2019s voice of commendation;

          After the third time (), Jesus corrected Jacob (James) and John about their

          of Jesus, meals were not eaten sitting at a table, but rather while reclining
          on one\u2019s side before a low table. There are two suppers mentioned
          in this chapter. At one, Jesus was a guest; at the other, he was the host.     
          An alabaster flask would itself be considered a luxury item in that day.
          Alabaster was a type of gypsum, very white and possibly translucent. It
          was found in caves and in limestone deposits.      This was spikenard (or
          nard), a spice taken from a plant that grows in northern India near the
          Himalayas. This costly perfume would have been carried over land to the

          worker a year\u2019s wages. It was a common practice among the Jews to

          Judah the locksmith. He most likely was the one who locked the collection

          his sad history that he wanted to lock up Jesus and control him for his

          alive through this night of suffering so that he could carry the cross
          and take away our sins. According to the prophecies of the Old Testament,
          Jesus was to be pierced on a cross. We learn from    that Jesus\u2019 prayer
          was answered that night as the cup was indeed taken from him. An angel
          of God came to strengthen him and deliver him from premature death ().
          The \u201Ccup\u201D he was asking God to let pass from him was the cup
          of premature death that Satan was trying to make him drink in the garden,
          not the death he would experience the next day on the cross. He had already
          sweat drops of blood (), but the prophecies had to be fulfilled of being
          pierced on a cross for our transgressions. God answered his cry and he
          lived through the agony of Gethsemane so that he could be our sacrifice
          for sin on Calvary. Jesus did not waver in the garden. We have a brave

        content: "  Traditionally, this young man was thought to be Mark, the author
          of this Gospel. Mark may be using the common literary device of allusion
          when speaking of himself. The Greek text uses the word  , which would mean
          that the young man was a teenager or in his early twenties.      This linen
          sheet is from the Greek word    and occurs in the Synoptic Gospels to describe
          the linen sheet used for burial cloth.    is also used for the young man
          () dressed in linen who announced to the women at the tomb that Jesus was
          alive (). This event can be seen as a foreshadowing of the resurrection,
          with the symbolism of the burial cloth and the escape from their clutches
          (in the next verse). Some believe that this young man wrapped in a burial
          cloth could have been resurrected in the nearby graveyard when Jesus spoke
          the words \u201CI Am.\u201D    "
