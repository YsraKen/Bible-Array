          called Merkabah Mysticism, or Chariot Mysticism, in which the initiate
          would seek to go into the palace of God through meditation and enter into
          his chariot-throne. His was the innermost palace of seven concentric heavenly
          palaces surrounding his chariot-throne. At each \u201Cpalace\u201D or level

          to be placated by angel worship, which would enable the worshiper to enter
          the next level. There were also ancient polytheistic folk religions that
          worshiped and invoked angels. These were entirely forbidden paths for believers

          many of those who translated this in the early church had difficulty with
          a church being led by a woman. There are some manuscripts in Greek that
          have \u201Cthe church that meets in    house.\u201D    "

          that this missing letter to the Laodiceans is, in fact, the letter to the

          letter to the Laodiceans was actually 1 and 2&nbsp;Thessalonians.    '

          of Colossae, perhaps the bishop of Laodicea; he is also mentioned in  .
          We can only speculate why Paul wanted this exhortation to be made to him.
          Some believe he was a minister of Christ who was discouraged and needed
          to be exhorted to not abandon his calling.  '
