          as partners in the heavenly calling.\u201D The Greek phrase, \u201Cheavenly
          calling\u201D implies an invitation to a celestial feast. It could also
          be translated \u201Cyou are called to share the life of heaven.\u201D This
          calling originates in heaven and draws us into heaven. However, in the
          Aramaic this phrase can be translated \u201Ccalled with a calling [from
          heaven],\u201D which is the Aramaic title of the third book of the Torah,
          Leviticus, and refers to the calling of the Levites as priests.      Or
          \u201Cyou have discovered this Jesus.\u201D The Aramaic can be translated

          binding agreement.\u201D      God joins the apostolic and priestly ministries
          together in Christ. An apostle will always release God\u2019s people into
          their priestly calling of entering into the holy of holies without going
          through a system, a church or a person. The word \u201CKing-Priest\u201D
          is from the Aramaic, which uses a word for a priest not of the Levitical
          order. Jesus could not be a \u201CHigh Priest\u201D for he was not born
          in the tribe of Levi, or a descendant of Aaron, but was of the tribe of
          Judah. So the word here for priest is not  , but the Aramaic word  , the

          Jesus was spared from death. What death? He gave his life on the cross
          for us. This seems to reveal that Jesus prayed in the garden to be spared
          from death that night and live long enough to die on the cross, and not
          prematurely die in the garden. Most expositors believe this was the \u201Ccup\u201D
          of God\u2019s wrath that was the sin payment. Yet it is possible that the
          \u201Ccup\u201D he was asking God to let pass from him was the cup of premature
          death in the garden, not the death he would experience the next day on
          the cross. He had already sweat drops of blood, but the prophecies had
          to be fulfilled of being pierced on a cross for our transgressions. God
          answered his cry and he lived through the agony of Gethsemane so that he
          could be our sacrifice for sin on Calvary. Jesus did not waver in the garden.

          Jerusalem is not only a place, but a people who dwell with God in their
          midst. It is a city that is a bride or a bridal-city coming out of heaven
          to the earth (). We are not going to the New Jerusalem; we are going to   
          the New Jerusalem! The breastplate worn by the high priest over his heart
          with its precious stones was a miniature scale model of the New Jerusalem.
          The New Jerusalem is the amplification of that breastplate, a metaphor
          of transformed sons with their names engraved upon the precious stones.

          of great joy and festivities with people wearing white robes and with garlands
          on their heads. (See Philo,    12; Isocrates,    43, 46.) This verse teaches
          that we have already entered into the festival of angelic bliss through
