          was fully restored in his relationship and partnership with the apostle
          Paul. Since Mark\u2019s death was in Alexandria in AD 62, the book of Philemon
          was obviously written before then. This is the only place in the New Testament
          that records Mark and Luke being in the same place. Paul had two Gospel
          writers who traveled with him.        means \u201Cbest prince\u201D (\u201Cruler\u201D).
          He was also known as Aristarchus of Thessalonica and is identified in church
          history as one of the seventy whom Jesus sent out. He was both a ministry
          companion of Paul and Paul\u2019s \u201Cfellow prisoner\u201D ().
