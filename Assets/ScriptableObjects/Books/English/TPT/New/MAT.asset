          The Greek text has no definite article (\u201CThis is the\u201D) and is
          most likely to be considered as a caption or title. The Son of God is eternal
          and had no beginning (;  ). The entire book of Matthew presents the beginning
          of the glorious story of Jesus, God\u2019s Anointed One. The genealogy
          given by Matthew presents the legal claim of Jesus to be King through the
          lineage of David from Joseph all the way back to the promises given to
          Abraham. Some believe Luke\u2019s account gives the genealogy of Jesus
          from Mary\u2019s lineage through David all the way back to Adam.      The
          Hebrew name for Jesus is    and means \u201Cis salvation.\u201D    "

        content: "  In    God pronounced a curse on Jeconiah\u2019s family line,
          declaring that they were ineligible to sit on the throne as kings. However,
          Luke\u2019s genealogy goes through David to Mary via Nathan, not Solomon,
          thus bypassing the curse of Jeconiah\u2019s lineage. Matthew\u2019s genealogy
          is meant to establish the legal right of Jesus Christ to be king. So Joseph,
          as Jesus\u2019    father, passes the right of David\u2019s throne legally
          to Jesus and avoids the curse of Jeconiah through Mary\u2019s ancestry.
          Jesus is the Son of God paternally, and the Son of David maternally through
          Heli, Mary\u2019s father. See footnote at  . From the beginning God said

          blood and water flowed. Blood and water come forth at birth. The first
          Adam \u201Cbirthed\u201D his wife out of his side, and so Jesus gave birth

          why the people of Jesus\u2019 day expected him to fight the Romans and
          free their land from foreign occupation. Jesus fulfilled both aspects of
          the meaning of Bethlehem in Gethsemane and on the cross, where he fought
          the \u201CGoliath\u201D of our souls and won, becoming Bread for the world.

          The Pharisees and Sadducees were two of the sects of Judaism of that day.     
          The word    in the Aramaic is  , which is really a reference to a scorpion.
          When a male scorpion mates it quickly dies. The mother scorpion dies when

          John implied in using the word    that Abraham died giving them birth and
          they have lost his guidance. But if the Pharisees would only turn to their

        content: "  The Aramaic and Greek use a word for \u201Cparable\u201D that
          means \u201Ca metaphor, allegory, simile, illustration, comparison, figure
          of speech, riddle, or enigmatic saying that is meant to stimulate intense
          thought.\u201D Throughout Hebrew history wise men, prophets, and teachers
          used parables and allegories as a preferred method of teaching spiritual
          truths. Poets would write their riddles and musicians would sing their
          proverbs with verbal imagery. Jesus never taught the people without using
          allegory and parables (). As a true prophet, one of Jesus\u2019 preferred
          methods of teaching was allegory. To deny the validity of allegorical teaching
          is to ignore the teaching methods of Jesus, the Living Word. This chapter
          contains seven parables of Jesus: (1) the parable of the sower, (2) the
          parable of the wheat and weeds, (3) the parable of the net, (4) the parable
          of the tiny mustard seed, (5) the parable of yeast, (6) the parable of
          the hidden treasure, and (7) the parable of the costly pearl.      The
          word    does not even appear in this parable or in the interpretation Jesus
          gave his disciples (vv.  ). What the farmer is sowing is the \u201Cchildren
          of the kingdom\u201D (v.  ). We who believe the message of the kingdom
          of God are the seeds that this farmer is spreading throughout the earth.
          The seed is the reality of Christ and his kingdom realm living inside of
          us.    "

          is that Jesus is the treasure, but Jesus taught that the field is the world
          (v.  ). The allegory breaks down, for a believer doesn\u2019t sell all
          he has (works) and then buy the world to find Jesus (the treasure). It
          is more plausible to view the hidden treasure as a symbol of you and me.
          Jesus is the man who sold all that he owned, leaving his exalted place
          of glory to come and pay for the sin of the whole world with his own blood
          just so he could have you, his treasure. Heaven\u2019s kingdom realm is
          experienced when we realize what a great price Jesus places on our souls,
          for he gave his sacred blood for us. The re-hiding of the treasure is a

          It is believed that during the time of Jesus there were approximately six
          thousand Pharisees in Israel. They refused to have dealings with common
          people because they were separated unto God. Jesus described them as religious
          frauds who loved money and wanted to be the final authority on all the
          doctrines that were taught to the people. They were not all priests, but
          zealous law keepers who wanted their interpretation of the Scriptures to
          be the standard in Israel.      The Sadducees () were wealthy aristocrats
          with political connections to Rome. They did not believe in the afterlife
          or angels or demons, and they denied the miraculous. It is believed that
          among them were Jewish converts from the Edomites who were forced to convert
          to Judaism in 129 BC by John Hyrcanus, the Hasmonean leader of the second
          century BC. The Sadducees loved Greek (Hellenistic) culture and basically
          rejected the oral law of the Pharisees. The Herodians would also be considered
          to be of the Sadducees. You can imagine how Jesus upset both the Pharisees
          and the Sadducees. Jesus had no difficulty breaking the traditions, taboos,
          religious teachings, and political loyalties of both Pharisees and Sadducees
          in order to please his heavenly Father.    "

          See    and footnote. There is an obvious pun only found in the Hebrew Matthew.
          The Hebrew word for \u201Cstone\u201D is  , and the Hebrew word for \u201Cbuild\u201D
          is  . The Greek text does state that Peter is the \u201Crock\u201D on which
          the church is built. However, the implication is that it is Peter\u2019s
          revelation from the Father and his confession of Jesus as the Son of God
          that becomes the \u201Cbedrock foundation\u201D for the church. The earliest
          writings of the church fathers all acknowledge that the Rock is Jesus Christ,
          not Peter. See  ,  ;  ;  ;  ;  .      In context, the rock is not Peter
          but the revelation he received from the Father that Jesus is the Christ.     
          The Greek word for \u201Cchurch\u201D is    and means \u201Clegislative
          assembly\u201D or \u201Cselected ones.\u201D This is not a religious term
          at all, but a political and governmental term that is used many times in
          classical Greek for a group of people who have been summoned and gathered
          together to govern the affairs of a city. For Jesus to use this term means
          he is giving the keys of governmental authority in his kingdom to the church.
          See R. Scott and H. G. Liddell,  , p. 206; J. H. Thayer,  , p. 196; and
          Oskar Seyffert,  , pp. 202\u2013203.      Or \u201Cthe gates of hell,\u201D

          of darkness that can stop the advancing church that Jesus builds.    "

          John, the forerunner, ministered in the spirit and power of Elijah. The
          same anointing of Elijah is present today to restore all things. (See 
          .) The Bible scholars had properly concluded that Elijah must come first,
          but failed to interpret it figuratively. This is often repeated today with
          biblical prophecies. We need the Spirit of Christ to help us understand
          even the basic truths of the Bible.    '

          Peter didn\u2019t ask Jesus first; he just said to them, \u201COf course!\u201D
          Yet Jesus still backed up Peter\u2019s word and performed a miracle to

          are those who from birth have grace to remain celibate. Second, sometimes
          a male was castrated, usually before puberty, which would greatly affect
          the hormonal changes of a boy becoming an adult. In biblical times, these
          eunuchs were chosen to be male servants of a king, having been castrated
          in order to ensure they don\u2019t have sex with the king\u2019s harem.
          Third, this is a metaphorical class of people (male and female) who are
          like \u201Cspiritual eunuchs,\u201D having been chosen to never use the
          bride of Christ for their own purposes. Jesus gives us a parable of God\u2019s
          servants who will lead the church but never harm or use the bride of Christ
          for their own desires. They will always point the bride to her Bridegroom,
          Jesus Christ. They have made themselves \u201Ceunuchs\u201D and are determined
          to extend God\u2019s kingdom, not their own. The rare Greek verb for \u201Cmake
          themselves eunuchs\u201D can also refer to being \u201Calways watchful,
          sleepless, diligent.\u201D To become a \u201Cspiritual eunuch\u201D has
          nothing to do with sex, but with always watching out for the interests
          of our King, and not taking for ourselves what only belongs to him in order

          The cup becomes a metaphor of the great suffering that Jesus had to drink
          that night in the garden. However, Jesus was not asking the Father for
          a way around the cross. Rather, he was asking God to keep him alive through
          this night of suffering so that he could carry the cross and take away
          our sins. According to the prophecies of the Old Testament, Jesus was to
          be pierced on a cross. We learn from    that Jesus\u2019 prayer was answered
          that night as the cup was indeed taken from him. An angel of God came to
          strengthen him and deliver him from premature death. The \u201Ccup\u201D
          he was asking God to let pass from him was the cup of premature death that
          Satan was trying to make him drink in the garden, not the death he would
          experience the next day on the cross. He had already sweat drops of blood,
          but the prophecies had to be fulfilled of being pierced on a cross for
          our transgressions. God answered his cry and he lived through the agony
          of Gethsemane so that he could be our sacrifice for sin on Calvary. Jesus
          did not waver in the garden. We have a brave Savior.      As translated
          from the Hebrew Matthew. See  , which may be evidence of Luke having access
          to the Hebrew Matthew account.    "
