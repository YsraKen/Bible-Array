          , which is not the highest name for God.  (Hebrew) or    (Latin) is the
          highest name.    is a title also used for false gods, land owners, merchants,
          and nobles. The Greek language has no equal to the sacred name (the tetragrammaton\u2014

          .      Note the seven steps of exaltation that God gave Jesus after the
          cross: (1) God exalted him and multiplied his greatness. (2) He possesses
          the greatest name of all. (3) His sovereign authority will cause every
          knee to bow. (4) God decreed that everyone in heaven will bow in worship
          of the God-Man. (5) God decreed that every demonic being will bow to the
          God-Man. (6) God decreed that every tongue will proclaim that Jesus Christ
