        the Father, who raised him from the dead. '

        content: "  The name Paul means \u201Clittle.\u201D His name before his conversion
          was Saul, which means \u201Csignificant one\u201D or \u201Csought after.\u201D
          What great transformation takes place when we experience a profound change
          as Saul did! God transforms us from being \u201Cimportant\u201D to being
          \u201Csmall\u201D in our own eyes. This is what qualifies God\u2019s apostolic
          servants.      The word    means \u201Cone who is sent on a mission\u201D
          or \u201Can ambassador.\u201D By implication, an apostle carries the delegated
          authority of the one who sends him. Jesus Christ chose Paul to be an apostle
          to plant churches and impart the revelation of Christ and his true gospel.
          The New Testament refers more often to the gift of apostle than all the
          other ascension gifts (prophet, evangelist, pastor, and teacher) combined.
