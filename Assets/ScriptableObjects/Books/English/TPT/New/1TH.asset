      number: 1
      content: "From Paul, Silas, [[COMMENT(0)]] and Timothy.  We send our greetings
        to you, the congregation  of believers in Thessalonica,  which is in God
        the Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.  May God\u2019s delightful grace  and
        peace rest upon you. "

        content: "  Or \u201CSilvanus,\u201D whom most scholars believe is the Silas
          mentioned as a prophet in the Jerusalem church and Paul\u2019s coworker
          in Macedonia (;  ;  ). The name Silas is the Aramaic form of the Hebrew
          name Saul. Both Silas and Timothy had been with Paul when he first visited
          Thessalonica (,  ). There are only four of Paul\u2019s letters in the New
          Testament in which he does not call himself an apostle (1 and 2&nbsp;Thessalonians,
          Philippians, and Philemon), most likely because of the deep relationship
          he already had with them.      Ministry requires teamwork. Paul saw himself
          as part of a church-planting team made up of three men with wonderful giftings:
          Paul, Silas, and Timothy.      The Greek word    is best translated in
          this context as \u201Ccongregation.\u201D It means \u201Ccalled-out ones.\u201D
          In Greek culture the    were members of society who were given the duties
          of legislating on behalf of a city, similar to a city council. They were
          both \u201Ccalled out\u201D and \u201Ccalled together\u201D to function
          as those who have the responsibilities of shaping societal norms and the
          morality of culture.      Thessalonica was the largest city in Macedonia
          and may have had a population of 200,000 when Paul wrote this letter.     
          The church is both \u201Cin\u201D God the Father and \u201Cin\u201D Jesus
          Christ. The Trinity is making room for the bride.      The usage of   
          (grace) in ancient classical Greek carries the connotation of something
          that awakens joy and pleasure. The Greek concept of grace imparts delight,
          often attached to a strong emotional element. Paul uses the term    as
          a joyous delight that rests upon the people of God (Thomas F. Torrance, 
          , 1\u20132).      Some manuscripts add \u201Cfrom God our Father and the
          Lord Jesus Christ.\u201D    "

          motive of love by serving God and others (v.  ). And they lived with undying

          the group identity of those who follow Christ and not meant to be gender
          exclusive. Paul uses the term eighteen times in five chapters. First Thessalonians
          could be called Paul\u2019s friendliest letter. He describes himself as
          a \u201Cfather\u201D and \u201Cmother\u201D to them (,  ) and calls them
          his \u201Cjoy\u201D and \u201Ctrophy\u201D ().      The perfect tense of
          the verb implies that God loved them in the past and continues to love

          as a figure of speech in Greek literature during the time Paul wrote this
          letter. The book of Enoch and the Dead Sea Scrolls use the same Greek word
          and imagery to describe spiritual victory, not a \u201Crapture.\u201D The
          word can describe being caught up in the victory of Christ\u2019s unveiling.
          Also, there are Jewish apocalyptic texts that use the same phrasing as
          Paul\u2019s writings but have nothing to do with a physical rapture.     
          There is no definite article before clouds. It is literally \u201Cin clouds.\u201D

          it is used as a descriptive term. The Greek word for \u201Ccloud\u201D
          is often used in the Greek classics of a large body of individuals, and
          it is so used in this symbolic way in  , speaking of the \u201Cgreat witnesses
          who encircle us like clouds.\u201D      The Greek word    is not a verb
          (go to meet) but a feminine noun (a meeting or an encounter), and in this
          context it is the bride of Christ rising to be with Jesus to have an encounter
          or \u201C[bridal] meeting.\u201D This rarely used Greek word is also used
          in the parable of the ten virgins, referring to the virgins rising up to
          meet (have a meeting) with the bridegroom. See  ,  .      This is the Greek
          word    and is not the sky, but the air around us. See    where it is also
