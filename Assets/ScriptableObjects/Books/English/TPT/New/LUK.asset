          (Migdal Eder) that the birthing of the Passover lambs would take place.
          Selected ewes that were about to give birth would be brought there. After
          the birth of the lambs, the priestly shepherds would wrap the lambs in
          cloth and lay them in a manger lined with soft hay to prevent them from
          hurting themselves, for Passover lambs must be unblemished with no bruise
          or broken bone. The miracle sign for these priestly shepherds would be
          a baby boy lying where the Passover lamb should be\u2014in a manger, wrapped
          in strips of cloth. It was at the cradle of Jesus Christ that the kingdom

          Some historians estimate that the Romans slaughtered more than one million
          Jews at that time and took captive up to one hundred thousand to other
          nations. Jews today still mourn the destruction of the temple on the fast
          of Tisha B\u2019Av, the ninth day of the fifth month.    "

          blood, is well documented. Under great emotional stress, tiny capillaries
          in the sweat glands can break, thus mixing blood with sweat. This process

      content: But Peter jumped up and ran the entire distance to the tomb to see
        for himself. Stooping down, he looked inside and discovered it was empty!
        There was only the linen sheet lying there. Staggered by this, he walked
        away, wondering what it meant.

          was sixty stadia = seven miles in the majority of manuscripts. However
          some patristic writers such as Eusebius, Sozomen, and Jerome, as well as
          a few Greek manuscripts read one hundred sixty stadia which would be seventeen
          miles. There is an ancient site in modern-day Israel identified as Hamat
          (Emmaus) that is seventeen miles from Jerusalem and is known for its hot
          (burning) springs. The word    is taken from a Hebrew root that means \u201Cthe
          burning place.\u201D    "
