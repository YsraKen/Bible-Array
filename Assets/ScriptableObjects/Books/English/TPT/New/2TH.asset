        content: "  The usage of    (grace) in ancient classical Greek carries the
          connotation of something that awakens joy and pleasure. The Greek concept
          of grace imparts delight, often attached to a strong emotional element.
          Paul uses the term    as a joyous delight that rests upon the people of
          God. See Thomas F. Torrance,  , 1\u20132.      Some manuscripts add \u201Cfrom
          God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ.\u201D    "

          and deserve their wages (). However, it seems that Paul\u2019s custom was
          to earn his own way when he went into a city for the first time to show
          the truth of the gospel without mixed motives. His ministry in Thessalonica
          was somewhat of an anomaly. Because there were believers who were lazy
          and not working for a living, Paul gave up his right to have financial
          support from them and chose to work \u201Cnight and day\u201D (v.  ) to
          be an example to them.    "

          The Hebrew word for \u201Cwork\u201D () is the same Hebrew word (a homonym)
          for worship. Our work can be a form of worship. Our lives are to be a seamless

          all our might for the glory of God.    "
