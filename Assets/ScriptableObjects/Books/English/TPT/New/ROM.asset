        content: "  The Greek word    signifies more than a servant; it is one who
          has chosen to serve a master out of love, bound with cords so strong that
          it could only be severed by death.      \u201CThe Anointed One\u201D is
          the best English translation of the Greek word  . Christ is not Jesus\u2019
          last name; it is a title for the Hebrew Messiah.      Or \u201Chis called
          apostle.\u201D Paul was a servant before he was an apostle.      Or \u201Cpermanently
          separated.\u201D There is an interesting wordplay here. The Aramaic word
          for \u201Cseparated\u201D is the root word for \u201CPharisee,\u201D a
          separated one. Paul is saying that God is the one who separated him as
          uniquely God\u2019s, as opposed to a self-righteous superiority. See also 
          .      This verse, although found in v.  , has been placed here in Paul\u2019s
          introduction for purposes of clarity. Verses    form the longest prescript
          in any ancient writing, including any of Paul\u2019s letters.    "

      content: For the person who observes one day as especially sacred does it to
        honor the Lord. And the same is true regarding what a person eats. The one
        who eats everything eats to honor the Lord, because he gives thanks to God,
        and the one who has a special diet does it to honor the Lord, and he also
        gives thanks to God.

          and dietary restrictions (kosher versus non-kosher). Paul addresses both

          culture there are religious traditions that are observed in varying degrees.
          As believers, our one tradition must be to love and not offend by deliberate
          actions that demonstrate insensitivity to others. The overarching message
          Paul brings in    is that we are obligated to walk in love and not put
          our preferences above love\u2019s calling to honor others. These principles
