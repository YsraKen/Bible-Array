          Christian writing through the second century is used only for Old Testament
          Scriptures. See Peter Davids,    (Grand Rapids, MI: Eerdmans, 2006), 207;
          Gene Green,    (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2008), 227; David Walls
          and Max Anders,    (Nashville, TN: B&amp;H Publishing, 1999), 113. See
          also  ;  ;  .      The comparative adjective    (more reliable) serves
          as a predicate adjective. \u201CAnd we have the prophetic word as more
          certain,\u201D meaning that the transfiguration confirmed (made more certain)
          the witness of the Old Testament Scriptures to Jesus as Messiah, the Son
          of God, who brought his eternal kingdom on earth (). The witness of God\u2019s
          Spirit through the transfiguration complements the witness of the Old Testament
          Scriptures in  \u2014both confirm that Jesus is the Messiah, God\u2019s
          Son, who will return to rule on earth. See Peter Davids,    (Grand Rapids,
          MI: Eerdmans, 2006), 207. What is said to be made more certain or reliable
          is \u201Cthe written message of the prophets.\u201D This has bothered some
          commentators in that it places experience ahead of the prophetic word,
          so they argue that the prophetic word makes the transfiguration more certain,
          citing later Jewish opinion that even a voice () from heaven could not
          overrule a Scripture. That, however, is not what the grammar of the text
          indicates. Instead, we see that \u201Cthe written message of the prophets\u201D
          is what is made more certain/reliable. See also M. Zerwick and M. Grosvenor, 
          , 3rd rev. edition (Rome: Editrice Pontificio Istituto Biblico, 1988),
          719; Lewis R. Donelson,    (Louisville, KY: Westminster John Knox, 2010),
          234: \u201CThis means that the account of the transfiguration makes OT
          prophecy more reliable.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. The giving of honor and glory
          to Jesus at the transfiguration reinforces the credibility of OT prophecies
          about the messiah\u201D; D. P. Senior and D. J. Harrington,    (Collegeville,
          MN: Liturgical Press, 2008), 257: \u201CThe idea seems to be that the transfiguration
          and all that pertains to Jesus fulfills and thus confirms what the prophets
          said and so makes them even \u2018all the more reliable\u2019&nbsp;\u201D;
          the same view was also held by the well-known Greek scholar of the early
          twentieth century; A. T. Robertson,  , vol. 6 (Nashville, TN: Broadman
          Press, 1931), p. 157.      Or \u201Clamp.\u201D See  .      This dismal
          or dark/murky place can be both the world in which we live and the human
          heart bathed in the light of truth, displacing gloom and darkness. See
