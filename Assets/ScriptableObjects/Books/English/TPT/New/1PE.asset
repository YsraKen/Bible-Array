          way the original audience would have described the situation in their day.
          \u201CRefugees\u201D is a modern equivalent in ours.      Pontus is the
          region of the Turkish coast of the Black Sea.      Galatia and Cappadocia

          Jesus.\u201D The calling of every believer is to share in the glory of
          God unveiled in Christ. See  ;  ,  ;  ;  .      Peter knows what he is
          talking about. After his ordeal of denying three times that he even knew
          Jesus, God restored him and made him strong. Jesus prophesied to Peter
          that he would \u201Cstrengthen the faith of [his] brothers.\u201D See 
          . Both of Peter\u2019s letters are anointed by the Holy Spirit to give
          you strong faith that will not give up.    "

        content: "  Or \u201Cthrough Silvanus.\u201D This could mean that Silas (Silvanus)
          assisted Peter in writing this letter and/or that he was the courier who
          brought it to the churches. In the book of Acts, Silas was a ministry partner
          of Paul who accompanied him on his first and second missionary journeys
          () and was imprisoned with Paul in Philippi (). However, in the epistles,
          Silas is named Silvanus (the Latin form of Silas). It is believed that
          Silas was one of the seventy disciples Jesus sent out and that he became
          the bishop of Thessalonica and was eventually martyred for his faith. The
          name Silas is the Greek form of the Aramaic name Saili (Saul).      The
          Aramaic adds a clause, \u201Cby which you have been resurrected.\u201D    "

        content: "  Or \u201CYour true sister in Babylon.\u201D This is a literal
          reference to the church of Babylon, according to the Aramaic. Since the
          Greek feminine pronoun is used here, many scholars have concluded that
          this is an allusion to the church, although some believe it could have
          been a reference to Peter\u2019s wife. Furthermore, Babylon may be a metaphor
          for the Roman Empire or even the city of Rome.      A possible reference
          to one of Peter\u2019s spiritual disciples, his spiritual \u201Cson\u201D
          is most likely John Mark, a relative of Barnabas (), who was the author
          of the Gospel that bears his name. Many believe that Peter was the literary
          source for much of Mark\u2019s Gospel. See also  ;  ;  ;  ;  .    "
