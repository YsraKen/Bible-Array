        the only one, for all who come to know the truth  share my love for you "

        content: "  Or \u201Cpresbyter.\u201D This was obviously a self-designated
          term for the apostle John. He was an elder because of being the only living
          apostle who was chosen by Jesus.      The letter is addressed to the   
          (\u201Celect/chosen/excellent lady\u201D). Most commentators see this as
          a metaphor for the church and her spiritual children, believing that John
          wrote this letter to a sister congregation or network of congregations.
          This has been the majority view since it was first noted by Jerome (Jerome, 
          ). Still, others see it as a letter to a specific woman, with the conjecture
          that her name was either Elekta or Kyria. This is a possibility, since
          one way to read the letter is that John knew this woman and was acquainted
          with her sister and her children (v.  ). If this was indeed written to
          Kyria (feminine of \u201Clord,\u201D meaning a woman in authority), there
          is a possibility that she was the pastor or overseer of a specific church.
          But who was the most especially \u201Cchosen woman\u201D in the entire
          Bible? It was Mary, the mother of our Lord Jesus. John was given the commission
          by Jesus himself in his last moments on the cross to care for Mary as his
          mother, and we know that Mary had a sister (, cf. v.  ). What other woman
          is chosen and loved, not only by John but all the church? Every believer
          in Jesus rightly honors and reveres his mother, Mary. Throughout church
          history there have been a few scholars who believe that Mary was the recipient
          of this letter. (See Knauer,  , 1833, Part 2, p.452ff.; q.v. J. E. Huther, 
          , translated from the German, 11 vols., Funk and Wagnalls, 1884.)     
          Or \u201Cwhom I love in truth.\u201D John uses the word    sixty-two times
          in the New Testament, while all the other New Testament writers combined
          use it a total of 116 times.      It is possible that John is using the
          word    as he uses    (Gr.  ), as a title for Jesus Christ (\u201Call who
          know the Truth\u201D).    "

          shows us that love is the safeguard against error. The more that love flows
